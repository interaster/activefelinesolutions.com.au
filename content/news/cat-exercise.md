<p>Cats, like humans and dogs, need exercise to stay healthy and fit. Though your kitty may enjoy lounging in a sunny spot on the carpet, she should be getting regular exercise every day. There are many things you can do to encourage your cat to exercise.</p> <p>Cats, on the other hand, can be difficult to get moving. There aren’t a lot of indoor kitty-related activities available, and let’s face it – when your cat decides he’d rather nap than humor you and your silly exercise program, there’s not much you can do to change her mind.</p> <p>Getting your cat active might be a challenge, but it’s not impossible. You can use <strong>interactive toys </strong>(<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Toys - Automatic Rolling Ball - Light Interactive Entertainment Exercise For Cats And Puppy Dogs\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MYoHdg" target="_blank" title="Light Interactive Entertainment Exercise For Cats And Puppy Dogs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Toys - Automatic Rolling Ball - Light Interactive Entertainment Exercise For Cats And Puppy Dogs</a>) </span> to engage your pet or this really <strong>handy laser pointer</strong> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2MVLTsB" target="_blank" title="Asien Pet Laser Pointer Cat Catch the LED Light Interactive Exercise Toy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Asien Pet Laser Pointer Cat Catch the LED Light Interactive Exercise Toy\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'>Asien Pet Laser Pointer Cat Catch the LED Light Interactive Exercise Toy -</span> Amazon</a>) we can get some awesome ones at online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a></p> <p>You can also think of creative ways to get your kitty to follow you around the house for exercise.</p> <p>You can also consider feline agility training to get your pet moving.

If it’s the same time every day, your cat will come to expect it and may come to you looking to play.<br><br><br><br> <h3>Allow your kitten to continue playing when you’re done<br><br> </h3> <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/meowing-kittens" title="kitten care"><strong>Kittens</strong></a> are usually very frisky and hyper and will likely play on their own for hours. If your kitten plays at a time that doesn’t work for you (like the middle of the night when you’re trying to sleep), alter her play schedule by initiating play at a time that works for you.<br><br><br> <h3>Encourage your older and overweight cat to move around<br><br> </h3> Older cats, or those that are overweight, will probably not want to play very often or for very long. Since it’s in their best interest to exercise, encourage your older or overweight cat to move around every day.<br><br><br> <h3>Provide exercise incentives with catnip<br><br> </h3> <p><strong>Catnip</strong> is a herb that some cats find irresistible. If your <a href="https://amzn.to/2KGeTb5" target="_blank" title="cat on catnip" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>cat is attracted to catnip</strong></a>, sniffing and eating the catnip can cause your cat to become more active and playful. If your cat isn’t interested in playing, provide her with some catnip to get her going.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Train your cat to walk on a leash</h3> <ul></ul> <p>Cats do not naturally <strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Leash-Train-a-Cat" target="_blank" title="cat on leash" rel="noopener noreferrer">take to a leash</a></strong> like a dog will, but if your cat is willing to try, it could be a fun exercise option for both you and your cat.<br><br></p> <h3>Consider getting your cat a playmate</h3> <ul></ul> <p>Individual kittens will find a way to play by themselves for hours, but adult cats may get bored on their own. If you’re away from home for long periods of time, you might want to consider <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/does-your-house-cat-need-another-feline-friend" title="cat companion"><strong>getting your only cat a playmate</strong></a>.<br><br><br><br></p> <h2>Creating Fun Activities for Cats<strong><br><br></strong> </h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image005_063aa247-6e02-40d0-a743-59e4ccc887b1_large.jpg?v=1526354994" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a></p> <h3>Stimulate your cat’s natural hunting instinct</h3> Cats are hunters. Even domestic cats retain the instinct to hunt and chase small things that move. Therefore, <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2MYoHdg" target="_blank" title="Cat Toys - Automatic Rolling Ball - Light Interactive Entertainment Exercise" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>toys</u></a> </strong>that stimulate hunting behaviour will usually be very enjoyable to your cat. For cat toys you can check pet stores or online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>.<br><br><br><br><br> <h3>Provide paper or bags for play<br><br> </h3> Packing paper or tissue paper are also great toys for cats. Start by crinkling the paper up so it makes noise when your cat jumps on it. Paper bags are another great toy. Cats love to explore the inside of paper bags and some will even hide their other toys inside. <strong>Do not</strong> use <strong>Plastic bags</strong> for yout cat as toys.<br><br><br><br> <h3>Give your cat a box or two</h3> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <p>“If I fits, I sits.” Cats love boxes. Even big cats in zoos love boxes. Cats are often known to play in a box . Putting out a couple of empty boxes can keep your cat occupied for hours, and create a new sleeping spot. Some cats also love to shred boxes until there’s nothing left. There’s nothing wrong with this, other than it’ll leave a big mess.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Set up a cat tree</h3> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image006_49ef4015-7fe9-4f70-8310-99e0cd9c60a5_large.png?v=1526358293" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a><br>Cats love being up high where they can observe and survey their kingdoms. Buying your cat an awesome <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWUPhj" target="_blank" title="cat tree" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat tree</a></strong> will help him get lots of exercise climbing up and jumping down. Place the cat tree in front of a window so your cat can also have a place to watch the birds, people, and anything else that might go by.<br><br>Most cat trees also double as a <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2MTiA9S" target="_blank" title="scratching post" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratching post</a>.</strong> You can also buy online by visiting websites like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>. or make, <a href="https://amzn.to/2nDK2hk" target="_blank" title="Cat Hammock Window Perches, Joyoldelf Window Mounted Pet Hammock Hanging Bed Set, Stable Sunshine Resting Seat with Strong Suction Cups " rel="noopener noreferrer">cat perches</a> that can be attached directly to your walls. If you place them at strategic locations around the house, your cat can jump from one to another to get from one room to another.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Running</h3> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <p>Whether it’s on a treadmill or in an exercise wheel (yes, they make those for cats), <strong>running</strong> can be a great source of exercise for your cat. Always supervise any type of equipment your cat is using and start off slow at first.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Food and Water Separation</h2> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <p>Move the <a href="https://amzn.to/2nDZ3Q8" target="_blank" title="Stainless Steel 2 Dog Cat Pet Feeder Twin Adjustable Stand Food Water Bowls" rel="noopener noreferrer">food and water bowls</a> to different places. Many cats eat and drink at the same time, so moving one bowl may encourage a little extra exercise. Some people recommend moving the bowls to high and low locations and back and forth as cats are eating, but I worry about tummy upsets and general frustration.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Scratching Posts</h2> <p> </p> <p>Posts or furniture design for scratching come with the host of benefits: your furniture avoids damage, your cat’s claw better maintained it helps toned muscles with every stretch and scratch. For good quality scratching post (see:<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Scratching Tree Post Sisal Pole Condo House Furniture Multi level Blue 260cm\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MRxHAL" target="_blank" title="Cat Scratching Tree Post Sisal Pole Condo House Furniture Multi level " rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Scratching Tree Post Sisal Pole Condo House Furniture Multi level Blue 260cm</a>) we can get easily online like at</span> <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Benefit Of Exercise For Your Cats</h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="http://oldmillvet.com.au/pet-library/the-benefits-of-exercise-for-your-pet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image008_88ed060d-bbe2-4e1c-9ada-79a07d724196_large.jpg?v=1526358436" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a><br>Cats are full of energy and that energy needs to go somewhere, otherwise problem behaviours may start and your pet will become more prone to health issues.<br><br>The great thing about exercising your pet is there are so many ways to do it. While cats use up energy playing ball and string, or figuring out a puzzle treat game. Even obedience training is a form of exercise. Check out <a href="http://oldmillvet.com.au/pet-library/the-benefits-of-exercise-for-your-pet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Care</a> and learn the benefit of giving your cat an exercise it needs. <br><br>Exercise is fun for all the family and a great way to bond with your pet. How else does exercise benefit your pet?<br><br><br></p> <h2>Exercise keeps your pet fit </h2> <p> </p> <p>Coupled with a healthy diet, exercise is the best way to keep weight off your cat – and helps you get fit too! <strong>Obesity</strong> can be a real problem in our pets and can lead to more medical issues, such as respiratory and joint problems. If your cat is obese, start exercise gently and track their weight – ask your vet for a weight-tracking chart.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Exercise keeps your pet healthy</h2> <p> </p> <p>Exercise helps to lower blood pressure and build up muscle. It’ll even help your pet have healthy bones. So 10-15 minutes of playing with your cats plus feeding them with healthy food makes a big help too.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Exercise can prevent behavioural problems</h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-behavior-and-psychology" title="cat behavior "><img alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTrVmJpXjboD6Kj3srVxLokaLRaXwhOQRhjo4Lj7BZFGoRGm-B4" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Exercise stops your pet becoming bored. This is particularly true for dogs – if you leave them alone in the yard or house, and forget to take them out for a run or walk, frustration creeps in. This is when problem behaviours such as digging holes, chewing furniture and barking at the drop of a hat begin.

A great way to get them out of their funk is to get out and exercise some more. Toys, puzzles and social activities also equal happy dogs and cats. It is also important to be safe while exercising with your pet. Just getting your pet moving by doing some activity like ball chasing, hide and seek, chase and outside training. Just enjoy spending time together.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Get an exercise plan for your pet</h2> <p> </p> <p>Different breeds need different exercise, and so do senior pets, puppies and kittens. Your 15-year-old cat might still think it’s a kitten so it’s up to you to decrease the intensity of their exercise. Ask your vet what sort of exercise is best for your cat or dog; they can set you up with an exercise plan.

There’s no magic here. The pet food companies make their foods the tastiest they can make it. And then there’s the misconception that when a cat isn’t eating it’s somehow sick. That’s not always the case. <p> </p> <h3></h3> <h3>Q: My cat has the run of the house, isn’t that enough exercise?</h3> <p>No. Could you get all the exercise you need just walking around your house? An indoor cat needs planned exercise. The best exercise is object play - playing with your cat with toys. That’s the answer to exercise problems, obesity, and how to get a well-adjusted cat. If your cat doesn’t get enough exercise, it comes out in bad ways.</p> <h3>Q: If I get another cat, will they get more exercise?</h3> <p>If it’s a kitten. Kittens are the high-energy ones. If it’s another adult cat, you have to be very careful. Bringing another adult cat into the house has very few positives for the established cat. What you need to do when you bring home another cat is buy a bunch of new resources - new toys, new food, new beds, new treats. So the association for your old cat is that this new cat comes in with a bounty, a dowry.</p> <h3>Q: Do cats like videos showing birds, squirrels, and other animals? Should I get them a fish tank or put up a birdfeeder outside a window that they can watch?</h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image013_12f85e7b-5be8-4774-b552-780c5f87b4c2_large.jpg?v=1526359047" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Some might like the videos, but I don’t personally know of any. I think those videos are really more for people who have guilt because they’re gone all day at work. But dragging a piece of string around for a little while when they get home is too much work, so they’d rather buy a video.<br><br>Now fish tanks are great. And cats love watching birds outside a window. I don’t recommend birds inside a house with cats, because birds are very intelligent and know they are being stalked. But a birdfeeder outside a window that cats can watch is a great idea.</p> <h3>Q: Can you train a cat to walk on a leash?</h3> <p>Yes, but they don’t get a lot of exercise from it because they’re too busy sniffing around and checking things out. The main reason to walk your cat on a leash is to safely give them some time outdoors when they can’t run away. It’s more mental exercise than physical exercise.</p> <h3>Q: My cat doesn’t like toys, or gets bored with them quickly. What can I do?</h3> <p>Toys for cats to play with by themselves have marginal interest. You’ve got this ball on a spring. The cat bops it a few times, it goes up and down, and the cat says “OK, now what?”</p> <p>Cats do want toys, but the toys should be “<strong>prey play</strong>” oriented. In the wild, a cat will only stalk prey for about three to five minutes. After that, he’ll give up and go search somewhere else. So don’t try to play longer than the genetic capacity of the cat.</p> <p>When he’s beginning to lose interest, change to another game. Now, some cats will really like bird and they’ll play that longer than other games. Some might really like the bug. Fine. It doesn’t have to be equal time.</p> <p>Also, let them win occasionally. Put a tasty treat under the toy and let them pounce on it, eat it, and win.</p> <p>Always put toys away after playtime that pose choking or ingestion risks like string, yarn or feather toys that lose pieces easily. Make sure climbing toys and structures are secure before letting your cat play on them.</p> <p>If your cat gets bored with one of these ideas, it’s easy to implement another one. Your time and creativity will offer a fun time with your cat while providing health benefits to you both.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://www.petplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/exercise-cat-large.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
