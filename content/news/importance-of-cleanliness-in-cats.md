<p><strong>(And Knowing The Best Product For Her)</strong> </p> <p>Cats are generally clean animals. Usually, they will spend 5-6 hours just grooming and cleaning themselves —and 16 hours sleeping. But sometimes even the most fastidious feline sometimes needs a makeover. You’ve no doubt watched your kitty washing herself several times a day. For the most part she can take care of herself very well, but sometimes she’ll need a little help from you. <br><br><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-care-and-grooming" title="cat grooming">Grooming your cat</a> can be an enjoyable experience and is a great way to bond with her. It provides solid health benefits and gets your cat used to being groomed and handled in case it becomes necessary later for medical purposes.</p> <p>It is best that you get started early, when your cat is still a young kitten (you may also like to check this book <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Complete Kitten Care - Kindle Edition"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2KEPMp7" target="_blank" title="kitten care book" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Kitten Care - Kindle Edition on AMAZON</a>)</span>, a how-to-guide for kittens so that in the long run, she is already familiar and is already get used to be bathed and groomed, and also for you to be familiar on her habits during those task (it will be much easier for you to approach her and groom her that way.)</p> <h1><span style="color: #f6b26b;">BATHING AND GROOMING</span></h1> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image002_379d65b0-e088-4fbd-8b17-9d6f7336ad85_large.jpg?v=1522651171" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Bathing and grooming sessions should be fun for the both of you to avoid stress for your cat and for you not losing your temper, and also to avoid wrestling her around and having minor injuries (light scratches), so be sure to schedule them when your cat’s relaxed, mostly after exercise or eating (you don't want to groom your cat when she's aggravated). <br><br>You want your pet to remember grooming sessions in a positive way. If you’ve had a stressful day or are in a bad mood, or if your cat is experiencing the same way too, it’s probably not a good time to groom her.</p> <p>For starters, keep your first grooming sessions <span style="color: #b45f06;"><span style="color: #000000;">short</span>,</span> especially bathing them (five to ten minutes for bathing is more than enough, anything longer will make your cat shiver). Gradually lengthen the time until your pet cat is used to the routine. You should also get your pet used to being handled while doing that. Get in the habit of petting every single part of your cat-including ears, tail, belly and back-and especially the feet.</p> <p>And keep in mind, a little patience can go a long way. If your cat is extremely stressed out, cut the session short and try again when she’s calmer, because if you do, it'll traumatize your cat to that point that it will struggle to escape every time, which may lead to injuries for the both of you. <br><br>Unfortunately, most cats do not like baths, so you may need another person to help (much better if it is someone the cat is familiar with). And don't forget to shower her with praise and offer her a treat when the session is over, it'll help your cat ease up and have something to look forward to on the next session.<br><br>Check out another article <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/bathing-your-kitty" title="kitty bath">Bathing Your Kitty</a> as it might help you and your cat in bath session.<br><br><br></p> <h1><span style="color: #f6b26b;">CLEAN IS HEALTHY</span></h1> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image004_a976addd-2a56-4e37-8a2d-cf3d7f0ac4b2_large.jpg?v=1522651201" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;">A clean cat is a healthy and happy cat, and for that, you need the perfect shampoo for her. There are a lot of shampoo and conditioner out there, readily available at supermarkets or on your local pet shop. <br><br>Don't use those products that is intended for human use. Humans and cats have different needs, and you can't just substitute cat shampoo for human shampoo, for it will hurt your cat if they groom their fur and human shampoo has chemicals that are toxic to cats. It also contains harmful dyes and chemicals that can irritate or hurt your cat's skin. <br><br>Don't use shampoo that is made for dogs as well, for just like human shampoo, it has the same effects on them.</p> <p>Look for products that have simple ingredients you recognize, as I have said earlier, cats groom themselves for long periods all the time, and by grooming means they are constantly licking themselves, eventually ingesting whatever is on their coat (including all cat care products you use on the fur). You can avoid this by knowing the exact ingredients on their shampoo.<br><br><br></p> <h2><span style="color: #f6b26b;">Let’s Take Note:</span></h2> <p>Don't rely on those products that is labeled "natural" or "<span style="color: #000000;">organic</span>". <br><br><strong>Quick reminder:</strong>Just because a shampoo or any cat product says with the label that it is all-natural doesn’t mean it doesn't contain any chemicals.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Read the label carefully</strong>, look for the active ingredients indicated, and watch out for any toxic substances included in the product (that also applies to other cat care products such as conditioners and other products). </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Natural ingredients</strong> such as tea tree oil, is toxic to them and might get them very sick. </p> </li> <li> <p>Also, in the event that your cat has a bad case of fleas, you may need to <strong>use shampoos with certain chemicals</strong>, but before purchasing one, consult your vet first and <strong>use only the products that they recommend</strong>, and also ask any alternative products to use if so.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Also, <strong>avoid products with artificial dyes, sulfates, or petrochemicals</strong> indicated on their label. These chemicals are <strong>highly toxic</strong> to your cats if ingested or applied to their skin (on this one, it depends on the cat). These chemicals may even appear, or a quite possibly the main ingredient of some products labeled as natural or organic. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Be always thorough in reading and checking</strong> the cat care products that you buy to avoid products that contain these chemicals.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your cat has fleas and ticks, you can <strong>bathe them with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2vKFfiu" target="_blank" title="Honeydew Natural Pet Shampoo for Dogs Puppies and Cat - Anti Itch Flea and Tick" rel="noopener noreferrer">flea and tick shampoo</a></strong>. This can help reduce allergic reactions to bites and kill the fleas on your cat’s body. And it is a dangerous to use fleas and tick shampoo to a kitten that is under six weeks old, much better if you wait until it reaches three months old before using it. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Make sure</strong> that you use <span style="color: #000000;">flea and tick shampoo</span> specifically <strong>designed for cats</strong>, for just like what I mentioned earlier, Flea or tick shampoos mad for dogs or humans have ingredients that are harmful to your cat, even if it is labeled natural or organic (for it may worsen your cat's current conditions which may lead to hair loss, skin irritations or even death). </p> </li> <li> <p>Also <strong>take note</strong> that Flea shampoos are a <strong>temporary solution</strong>. They get rid of living fleas but do not kill eggs, so they won’t help prevent future outbreaks. There are lots of effective options – best thing to is to consult your vet first about other flea prevention methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Look for a <a href="https://amzn.to/2vIXdSC" target="_blank" title="AuCatStore(TM) Pet Dog Cat Neutral Hair Shampoo Unscented" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat shampoo</a></strong> that is specifically designed for some cat problems such as itchy skin, dandruff, irritated skin, or sensitive skin. These shampoos have <strong>special ingredients that help ease your cat's skin problems</strong>.</p> <p>If you are still not sure on what particular shampoo to buy for your cat's condition, you may online shops such as <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>, as well as your vet will always be there to help you decide on which is the best one that you need.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alright, so you have the best shampoo now, but what if your cat gets skin irritation or allergic reactions after using it? You may want to try a <span style="color: #000000;">medicated shampoo</span>.<br><br> These products have special ingredients that reduces inflammation and redness, decreases itching and soothes your cats skin too, but if your cat has badly irritated skin or the situation turned to the worse after using a medicated shampoo, you need to consult your vet as soon as possible to so that he or she can provide a adequate medical attention right away.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image006_37768979-0d2f-43ec-a888-5574383c1d5c_large.jpg?v=1522651258" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">Now let's move to conditioners. Just like before, avoid products for humans and horses. <br><br>Conditioners for humans and horses have some residues are intentionally made to stay on the skin. Since cats self-groom by licking their fur, they can end up ingesting these residue and get sick. Only use <span style="color: #000000;">coat conditioners that are made specifically for cats and if possible, approved by an expert. </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Usually, cat shampoos hav</span>e added a conditioning agent to their formulas or contains both shampoo and conditioner, which may be a good choice if you what you will get is a 2-in-1 product and you don't need to buy a separate product for your conditioner (eliminating additional cost) and want to condition your cat's coat at the same time you bathe them (helps save time too). <br><br>On the other hand, if your cat has dandruff, dry skin or a brittle coat, an anti-dandruff shampoo may be required. This product contains conditioning chemicals (which is safe for your cat if accidentally ingested) that helps make the coat softer and add moisturizes it too.</p> <p>And yeah, you don’t need to use conditioners on short-haired cats, for it doesn't make any difference at all (you won't expect a short-haired person to apply conditioner on their hair right?). <br><br>Conditioners are made specifically for cats that have a medium to long coat. They help keep the coat silky, shiny, soft, and tangle-free. Some conditioners even help prevent hair loss or excessive shedding on cats. If you have a cat with a long coat that you'd like to look shinier or silkier, then you can use a <span style="color: #000000;">leave-in conditioner.</span> <br><br>To use this product, you spread a small amount of the leave-in conditioner over the coat after bathing and drying her out (preferably using a hair blower, making sure she is dry all over and to avoid her getting sick if not dried out immediately). <br><br>Don't rinse it off, but let it soak into the coat. Massage it to evenly so that it also reaches the inner part of her coat and to the skin too, and afterwards, brush or comb your cat's hair to eliminate tangles and even ensure a much more even distribution all over her body.

A great example, which doesn't require to bath your cat every day, is <span style="color: #000000;">Cat Shampoo Wipes.</span> <br><br>Cat shampoo wipes are a type of bathing alternative you can use on your cat and can be of great help when you need to clean a pregnant cat or an overweight cat’s bottom and back area, because such kitties often can’t reach every inch of their body when cleaning themselves.</p> <p>Moreover, you can use them to reduce the Fel-d1 allergen agent, which causes cat allergies. They are also great for removing dirt, dander, and unpleasant odor from your pet’s fur.. The wipes have a cleaner on them that you can wipe over your cat’s coat to remove dirt, urine, and other types of debris.<br><br></p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image008_1016289e-d54b-46ba-8f0d-b54f652f1fc0_large.jpg?v=1522651435" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Opting for <a href="https://amzn.to/2vJoJzh" target="_blank" title="Hypo Allergenic Wipes for Pets, 100ct " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">cat wipes</span></strong></a> in between bath days is an excellent way to maintain your cat’s hygiene (It also save you from hassle if your kitty is still not used to bathing). Cat wipes are similar to baby wipes, but they are specifically manufactured for felines. They are pet-friendly and can be used on a daily basis without any side effects. <br><br>Cat wipes deodorize, clean, and freshen up your cat, preventing saliva, dirt, and bacteria from getting stuck on its skin and fur. As a result, the wipes will also reduce Fel-d1 allergen and other airborne agents that may cause sickness to your kitty.</p> <p>Other kinds of product includes cat grooming foams, which is waterless products that can clean your cat. You don't need to get your cat wet, just simply wipe your pet cat first to remove debris or falling hair and apply directly to her dry coat, massaging it on their coat all over the body (make sure to avoid the face, especially the eyes, nose and mouth. <br><br><a href="https://amzn.to/2nEIjbn" target="_blank" title="TropiClean Waterless Deep Cleaning Pet Shampoo No Rinse Formula " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cat no-rinse shampoo</strong></a> are also popular among cat owners and has the same function and application as cat grooming foams. There is also cat powder, unlike other products, it is not in liquid form, which means it can soak up oils and grease on cats with longer coats. It also locks in moisture on their coat, avoiding dry skin on your cats. Applies the same way as <span>cat grooming foams and cat no-rinse shampoo,</span></p> <p>For all the products mentioned above, you may want to wash your hands after applying them so that you may not contaminate other things that you touch (especially their food), and of course , always read the instructions and follow the directions carefully.</p> <p>So that's it! your cat now is clean, refreshed, smells good, and overall shinier than before. That will ensure that your cat is free of dirt, tangled hair and other contaminants that may cause sickness.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
