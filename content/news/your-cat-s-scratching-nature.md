<p>Why do cats scratch anything and everything? Have you ever wondered why they behave in such manner?</p> <p>Scratching is actually natural with cats. It’s one of their primal and instinctual urges. This is something that they do their whole lives. It may seem like a pointless and inconvenient cat behavior, but there are actually many explanations why they do it. See also: <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-behavior-and-psychology" title="cat behavior">Cat Behavior and Psychology<br><br></a></p> <h2>Instinct</h2> <p> </p> <p>Animals have certain instincts. Cats were given claws, so of course they want to use them. All cat breeds do it. Scratching is a vital part in a feline’s everyday life. They also do it to strengthen their paws, shed old cuticle and sharpen their claws.</p> <p>Cats scratch things as a means of flexing and stretching the muscles in their back and their upper body. It’s just something you have to admit. Training them to scratch where you want may work best when you accept and appreciate the power of the feline’s natural instinct. This keeps your cat in shape too!<br><br></p> <h2>Advantage for Their Claws</h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image002_579be601-4f97-4e6b-bb71-416403bad4df_large.jpg?v=1526282534" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br><br>This action of scratching is referred to as <strong>stropping</strong>, loosens and removes the outer husk of the claw revealing a sharp new surface underneath. Claw sharpening is an act of grooming for the cat.

This keeps the nails healthy, strong and conditioned. In the wild, a cat’s claws are an excellent climbing aid as well as a hunting tool. Keeping them sharp is clearly essential. The dull surface layer on their claws may also be a source of irritation or discomfort so removing it is an important part of maintaining healthy nails. <br><br>Cats who do not scratch and claw often wind up with over grown nails that grow into the paw pad if not trimmed, this makes walking painful and will cause an infection.<br><br><br></p> <h2>To Mark Territory</h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image003_886340f0-d756-4a56-a594-2724581c35c0_large.jpg?v=1526282569" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br>By nature, cats are <strong>territorial</strong>. They mark the most visible portions of your house and even in the wild. When a cat scratches something, she is leaving her scent and this marks as its territory or turf. Their <strong>paws have scent glands</strong> that allow them to dispense a distinct smell.<br><br>If cats could speak they would have said “Hey this is my domain, back off” to others. Though some cats will scratch more when in the presence of other cats. <br><br>Exactly what they are trying to convey is not well understood, but this type of scratching may be done as a display and to leave a scent and to communicate with other cats in the vicinity.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Relieves Stress and Anxiety</h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Not all cat behaviors are alike</strong>. They also scratch things to c<strong>ommunicate and release emotions</strong>. Some cats do this to work off stress and anxiety. Scratching also serves as a means of kitty anger management.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image004_6b9ff3c9-7698-4a9c-b288-3053a7dec964_large.jpg?v=1526282605" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Angry felines scratch things to release their frustration. Some scrape people and this can be a warning or defensive tactic when cats feel threatened. The motions stretch out their backs and shoulders, and the physical exertion helps calm them and relieve stress.</p> <p>It’s either they do this to converse their happiness or aggressions. Cats that have a sudden increase in the amount of scratching means they’re stressed out. Having a new pet, a new house or always going away may add on to your cat’s anxiety and stress.</p> <p>Cats that are scratching as a result of stress may also be showing other behavioral signs. Some of these include: hiding, decreased appetite and aggression towards human or other pets at home.<br><br><br></p> <h2>It May Be Part of Their Play</h2> <p> </p> <p>This could actually be their way of saying “Hello” or “I miss you, where have you been?” or maybe they just want to purely play that’s why they scratch you or your furniture at home. But most of the time, your cat scratches because it makes them feel good.<br><br></p> <h2>Scratching on Furniture</h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image005_de1815e9-a3d7-4f8e-8baa-92dc219ce12f_large.jpg?v=1526282662" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br>Furniture scratching. So many people are convinced this is a behavior displayed by cats just for the sheer thrill of destroying the living room sofa or treasured antique chair.<br><br>If you live with a cat who has turned your upholstery into mere shreds, you’re probably at your wit’s end in terms of whether keeping kitty means abandoning all hope of ever having intact furniture again.<br><br>The problem is that you might’ve gone at this the wrong way. You were trying to train your cat to <strong>NOT</strong> do something that is actually a normal and essential part of being feline. Scratching is important and more complex than you may realize. You might be under the misconception that scratching is merely your cat’s attempt to only sharpen his claws to razor-sharp perfection or that this cat behavior is based on a willful attempt to get back at you or destroy his surroundings.

Since he still has a natural need to scratch, the behavior will still be done but it’ll occur when you aren’t around. So be ready when you come home and have a down living room.<br><br>Cat lovers often think that these fur babies only scratch on vertical surfaces, like wooden posts, sofa and chairs but they are equally keen to scratch on horizontal surfaces like rugs and carpets too!<br><br>Carpet is not generally a preferred scratching substrate for cats. The loops catch their nails, resulting in unpleasant pulling on their toes.<br><br>Cats also prefer scratching rougher surfaces that more closely resemble tree trunks. However, if cats don't have access to proper scratching posts, they will use what is available to them, usually furniture like couches, dressers, and footstools. These cats will often scratch at carpets as well.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Take Necessary Actions</h2> <p> </p> <p>The best tactic when dealing with scratching is not to try to stop your cat from doing it, but instead to teach her where and what to scratch. An excellent approach is to provide her with appropriate, cat-attractive surfaces and objects to scratch, such as scratching posts. The following steps will help you encourage your cat to scratch where you want her to.</p> <p> </p> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image007_ea6f319e-38cd-426d-aea0-2a53579eafc7_large.jpg?v=1526282880" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> <p><br>Provide a variety of cats scratching posts with different qualities and surfaces. Try giving your cat posts made of cardboard, carpeting, wood and upholstery. Some cats prefer horizontal posts.<br><br>Others like vertical posts or slanted posts. Some prefer a vertical grain for raking, while others favor a horizontal grain for picking. Once you figure out your cat’s preference for scratching, provide additional posts of that kind in various locations.<br><br>Keep in mind that all cats want a sturdy post that won’t shift or collapse when used. Most cats also like a post that’s tall enough that they can stretch fully. I found many pretty good cat scratching posts (such as: </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style> <p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Scratching Post Tree Scratcher Pole Gym Sisal House Furniture Tall Grey 92cm\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTuXP" target="_blank" title="scratching post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Scratching Post Tree Scratcher Pole Gym Sisal House Furniture Tall Grey 92cm</a>)</span> at online store like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>.<br><br>Placement is important when trying to entice your cat to use a scratching post. Because scratching is also a marking and a natural cat behavior, most cats prefer to use a post that is placed in a prominent location.
