<p>Bringing a new kitten home is nothing cuter than a playful, cuddly little furball. Your kitten will quickly grow into an adult cat, and with a bit of luck, the two of you will be best friends for many years to come.</p> <p>You can get the relationship off to a great start – and ease the nerves of both human and furball! – by making sure that you have everything your kitten will need.</p> <p>Here’s a look at what you’ll need to have on hand when your kitten arrives.<strong> </strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong> </strong> <h2><span style="color: #e06666;">QUALITY FOOD (wet or dry)</span></h2> </li> </ul> <p>When you go to the store to look for cat food, you’ll see bags of dry food and cans or pouches of wet food. <br><br><strong>Wet food</strong> is often less expensive, and while it is usually made with real meat, it can have too much protein. Older cats can usually process the extra protein better than younger cats, so you should avoid giving can cat food to cats younger than a year old. <br><br><strong>Dry food</strong> is usually roasted and doesn’t have as much water as food in cans. You can usually get a bag of dry food for a few dollars if your cat isn’t too picky, but you need to be aware of the ingredients. Dry food will usually last longer because you’re not going to give your cat a large amount at one time. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/1_16159fb0-9dd5-4520-959d-fb270c4f53c7_large.jpg?v=1522892212" style="float: none; margin: 10px1 10px 10px 10px;"></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Finding quality food is one of the things that you need to look for when searching for the best cat food is the first ingredient. It should be some kind of meat. Since cats are carnivores, they rely on protein in their diet. Foods that have a meat listed as the first ingredient have a higher percentage of protein compared to a food that has a grain listed as the first ingredient.</p> <p>When you find a few cat foods that are suitable to give your cat, look to see if there are any recalls. You should also review the customer satisfaction rating to see what other people think of the food and how their cats react. Cats need to eat food that has a higher amount of moisture because they usually don’t drink a lot of water during the day. You need to find foods that are easy to digest. Foods should also have few carbohydrates as they can make your cat gain too much weight. There usually isn’t one clear cat food that is at the top of the list. Once you start researching, you’ll be able to find a food that your cat enjoys and that is healthy for him</p> <p>Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that they rely on nutrients found only in animal products. They evolved as hunters that consume prey that contains high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and a minimal amount of carbohydrates, and their diet still requires these general proportions today. Cats also require more than a dozen other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids.</p> <p>Although your cat needs certain amounts of each specific nutrient to be healthy, more is not always better. This is particularly true of vitamins and minerals, so the use of supplements is usually not necessary if you are feeding a balanced and complete diet. Supplements can be harmful to your cat, and they should never be given without a veterinarian’s approval. Cats should have access to clean, fresh water at all times.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong> </strong> <h2><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong>KITTY LITTER BOX</strong></span></h2> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/2_a3fd6d22-274e-4035-93f4-220d2e1c89d6_large.jpg?v=1522892274" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>One of the perks of having a cat is that they’re inclined by nature to ‘go’ in the same area each time. No poop-scooping missions in your backyard will be necessary. But that means you’ll need to have a litter box for your cat. There’s a wide range of options available. A litter box can be as simple as a plain plastic tray, or as complex as an automated poop-handler. Whatever works best for your budget and preferences will be fine like the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KAR5W1" target="_blank" title="Self sifting litter box" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"3 in 1 Self Sifting Tray Cat Litter Box Simple Stylish Antimicrobial Pet Cat Toilet Training Tray"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'>3 in 1 Self Sifting Tray Cat Litter Box Simple Stylish Antimicrobial Pet Cat Toilet Training Tray</span></a> in Amazon and the like. We can also get them from online stores like the <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a>. <br><br>But when it comes to the litter that goes in the box – well, your cat might have a say in what you use. If you notice your cat exhibiting some reluctance in using the litter box, it may be because of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KPgWVs" target="_blank" title="Arm &amp; Hammer Clump &amp; Seal Multi-Cat Complete Odour Sealing Litter " rel="noopener noreferrer">litter</a>. Try another brand, it might take experimenting with a few brands before kitty is content, but then all will be well.</p> <p>As most cat owners know, <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/importance-of-cleanliness-in-cats" title="cleanliness in cats">cats are very clean animals</a>. That is why it is important to keep a clean litter box. A cat’s sense of smell is 14 times stronger than ours, so a stinky litter box can cause your cat to look for an alternate location to do their business.</p> <p>Location is important. Litter boxes should be put in a quiet area of the house, away from noisy appliances and high traffic areas. Keep in mind that kitten and elderly cats can have a hard time climbing stairs, so if you are going to keep the litter box in the basement, make sure they can get to it easily. It is also important to keep it in an area where they don’t feel trapped by another cat using the box.

They need to scratch. And they will scratch; it’s instinctive! The only question is: What will your cat scratch? The smart move is to give your cat something that it will love to scratch, and that’s made for scratching that’s a scratching post. <br><br>As with most of the kitty equipment you’ll be buying, you’ll be able to choose from a multitude of brands and varieties. But here are a few tips for buying a just right scratching post for your pet: </p> <p><strong>It should be sturdy and stable</strong>. A cat can hit a post hard in a vigorous play attack, so you want to be sure that the post will remain in place and upright. A rubber base might be helpful.</p> <p><strong>It should be tall</strong>. In general, something in the range of 25 to 30 inches will probably be about right. It should be at least as tall as your full-grown cat’s reach when it’s standing on its hind legs.</p> <p><strong>It should </strong>probably<strong> be vertical</strong>. Most cats like vertical scratching posts. But a few seem to prefer horizontal scratching posts. So if you find that your cat doesn’t seem inclined to play with its vertical post, you might need to trudge back to the store for a horizontal post.</p> <p>If you are not sure what to get, there a lot of choices of scratching post you can get online like at <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a>.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong> </strong> <h2> <span style="color: #e06666;"><strong>FOOD AND WATER BOWLS</strong></span> </h2> </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/cat-food-dishes-feeders-and-fountains-dog-water-bowl-mason-jar-dispenser-dish-container-puppy-kitten-kitty-buy-it-now-only-to-slow-eating_large.jpg?v=1532310757" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>You’ll need food and water bowls for your cat, of course. <a href="https://amzn.to/2nDZ3Q8" target="_blank" title="Stainless Steel 2 Dog Cat Pet Feeder Twin Adjustable Stand Food Water Bowls New " rel="noopener noreferrer">Stainless steel bowls</a> are the favorites among vets because they are easy to clean and sterilize. <strong>Glass and ceramic</strong> are also popular. <strong>Plastic bowls</strong> aren’t recommended because they may retain smells that the cat will find repellent. Plastic bowls are also more likely to be host to a kind of bacteria that can cause a type of feline acne.<br><br>Whatever the material of the bowl, make sure that it’s shallow in design – especially if your cat is still a small kitten. The cat will be more comfortable if it can easily reach the food.</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2vLVhIZ" target="_blank" title="BAOBLADE Elevated Feeder Pet Stainless 2 Bowls for Dog Cat Water Food Acrylic Stand " rel="noopener noreferrer">Food bowls</a> should also be as far apart as possible for privacy because most cats need the feeling of safety and knowing that others can’t steal their food.</p> <p>Carnivores don’t like sharing food. It’s upsetting to them and goes against their nature. Stresses like this in the home can lead cats to fighting, spraying, and peeing outside of the box. And you know how unpleasant that is, for everyone!</p> <p>If you have a cat or two that are particularly territorial or if you have hissing and swatting in the designated dining area consider feeding a cat separately in a bed room with the door closed. Allow the cats enough time to finish their meal before you collect and wash the bowls – usually 30 minutes is more than enough time.<strong> </strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <strong> </strong> <h2><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong>INTERACTIVE TOYS</strong> </span></h2> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/cat-toys" title="cat toys"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/5_c9d36cca-8a75-4cea-9e2a-e4e25692c753_large.jpg?v=1522892443" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Kittens are playful critters, and playtime is an important component in their development. Cat toys are great playtime tools, and just about any purpose-built toy that your cat enjoys will be fine. <br><br>For cats in the wild, the act of play is actually a serious business that helps kittens learn important survival skills like stalking, chasing and trapping prey. Interactive play between you and your cat may also help prevent some behavior problems that can arise from boredom. Just be sure that the cat can’t get any small pieces off the toy. Anything smaller than a ping-pong ball should be considered a potential choking threat.</p> <p>And don’t offer your hand to your kitten to swat at as a play toy. It might be cute now, but it won’t be when the cat is larger and has become conditioned to attacking your hands for fun!<strong> </strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <strong> </strong> <h2><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong>HYGIENE AND GROOMING</strong> </span></h2> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/cat-grooming_and_hygiene_large.jpg?v=1532311637" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">You’ll want to keep your cat looking cute with the proper grooming equipment. At a minimum, you’ll want to have a metal-toothed comb (careful not to get one with sharp teeth), a bristle brush, and a flea comb. If you have a long haired cat, you’ll probably also need a wire brush (you can buy a wire/bristle combo brush if you wish),a metal-toothed comb with alternating long and short teeth or a slicker brush.</p> <p>A deshedder tool might also belong on your want list. Deshedders remove loose hairs before they can cause matting on the surface of the cat’s coat, and will make grooming duties considerably easier.</p> <p><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-care-and-grooming" title="cat grooming"><u>Grooming</u></a> also serves as a massage of sorts for your cat. The repetitive action of licking helps to relieve stress and improve circulation, much like muscle and tissue massages do for humans.<br><br><br></p> <ul> <li> <h2><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong> </strong><strong>CAT COLLAR AND CAT CARRIER</strong> </span></h2> </li> </ul> <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20130612-catster-tie-hero.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></div> <div style="text-align: center;"></div> <p>While you’re not likely to be taking your cat out for a walk with a lead and collar, it’s still a good idea to have a collar for your cat. The collar should offer either ‘break away’ or ‘snap away’ features. Those safety features could prevent your cat from becoming helplessly stuck should its collar should become snagged on something. And of course you should have an identification tag on the collar.</p> <p>Be sure to also buy a cat carrier. It’s the only safe way to transport your cat, even if you don’t plan any trips longer than to the nearest vet. A loose cat in a car is not a good thing! Again, you’ll be faced with a bewildering array of choices. Just make sure that the carrier you choose is well ventilated and sturdy. </p> <p>Cat carriers are becoming more popular because more cat owners are coming to realize the importance of carrying their cats in <a href="https://amzn.to/2KByPvu" target="_blank" title="cat carrier" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat carriers</a>. </p> <p>Cat carriers come in two basic materials. Soft nylon mesh and hard plastic. We use the soft nylon mesh type to travel with out cats because the carriers fit nicely in the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KCPS0u" target="_blank" title="car seat carrier" rel="noopener noreferrer">rear seat of our car</a>. </p> <p>Some carriers only have an opening in the front while others have an opening at both ends as well as the top. If you have ever tried to get a scared cat out of a carrier with only a front opening then you will appreciate why it is very important that your carrier at least have an opening at both ends. Preferably your carrier should have an opening at both ends and at the top.</p> <p>Since the carrier is supposed to provide protection for the cat it only makes sense that no part of the cat should be able to stick out through the carrier. Your carrier should be leak proof and secure. You do not want your cat to be able to open the openings. The carrier should be big enough so that the cat can stand fully erect and be able to turn around.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
