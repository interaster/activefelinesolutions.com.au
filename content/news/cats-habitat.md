<p>Cats are animals that <strong>do not have a specific habitat</strong> that is suited to them and their habitats can often change; they are referred to as a <strong>cosmopolitan species</strong>. Cats are <strong>able to adapt to a variety of environments</strong> including forests, deserts, urban and the homes of humans.</p> <p>Cats are among the most common pets in the world and are kept as pets on nearly every continent of the Earth. They are regarded as loyal and simple to care for animals, making them ideal pets. Due to their adaption abilities, cats can <strong>easily adjust</strong> from an outside living environment to an indoor home environment surrounded by humans. <br><br> Cats that are kept as pets are not solitary animals and prefer to be around other cats.</p> <p>Cats are carnivorous animals that prefer to prey on food that they intend to eat. They are able to survive on smaller animals, such as mice, in the wild.</p> <p>They can be fed commercial cat food when they are in a home environment, but they are particularly helpful in homes that have a large instance of small rodents. Female cats are generally smaller than male cats. They can have several periods of heat throughout the year and most cats live to be between 12 and 15 years old.

OUTDOOR CATS</h2> <p><br>Owning a cat is a wonderful thing, but there are many questions that need entertained before you can select your new friend and decide how they will live. One such question is the environment that you will be able to provide for the cat.</p> <p>There are 3 choices when it comes to the territory that you will allow your cat to explore: indoors, outdoors, and both.</p> <p>The first, and most important, thing to keep in mind when considering where you will allow your new friend to find adventures is that the decision should be based on <strong>both</strong> considerations for you and considerations for the cat. There are definitely things that should be thought about from both sides of the relationship.</p> <h3></h3> <h3></h3> <h2>Pros and Cons ..<strong><br><br></strong> </h2> <h3>Indoor Cats</h3> <h3> <strong><br> </strong>Advantage:</h3> <p>Indoor cats certainly make great house pets, but there are some things that should be kept in mind for cats in this situation. The most significant consideration for deciding between keeping a cat indoors versus allowing for them to venture outside is safety. Indoors cats are obviously less likely to get into fights with other animals, have encounters with motor vehicles or other dangers, and contract fetal illnesses such as <a href="http://aspengrovevet.wpengine.com/feline-immunodeficiency-virus-infection-fiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</a> or <a href="http://aspengrovevet.wpengine.com/feline-leukemia-virus-felv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)</a>. Your cat will need your help to get adequate exercise and maintain a healthy body condition which means lots of playtime!</p> <h3>Disadvantage :</h3> <p>Keeping a cat indoors at all times means they can become very dependent on its owners for stimulation, which can result in the cat being stressed during times of the owner’s absence and also a potential for the cat to be “clingy” when the owner is home. Additionally, even with proper environmental enrichment and scratching posts, some cats are still destructive to furniture.</p> <h3>Do’s:<strong><br></strong> </h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Provide adequate environmental enrichment (hunting games, hiding places, perches, <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/cat-toys" title="cat toys">toys</a>, etc.) for exercise and mental stimulation</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul> Keep a close eye on nutrition and body condition to avoid obesity</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul> Interact with your cat daily</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <div> <ul></ul> Invest in a couple of scratching posts (such as: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Scratching Tree Post Scratcher Pole Condo Gym Toy Furniture Multilevel 126cm\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MXUScL" target="_blank" title="cat scratching tree" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Scratching Tree Post Scratcher Pole Condo Gym Toy Furniture Multilevel 126cm</a> or </span><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Scratching Tree Post Scratcher Pole Condo Gym Toy Furniture Multilevel 126cm\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MTiA9S" target="_blank" title="cat scratching post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Tree Scratcher JUMBO 180cm - BEIGE-amazon</a>)</span>.

Additionally, time outdoors can promote mental health as it gives a cat time to explore and keep their mind active.<br><br> <h3>Disadvantage:</h3> Housing an outdoor cat means that you will have to be cautious about fleas both as a health concern for the cat and also with regard to fleas in your home. Even with a flea product (such as a <a href="https://amzn.to/2vFMxUM" target="_blank" title="Audza Dog Cat Repel Tick Flea Quick Kill Remover Pet Protection Aroma Neck Collar" rel="noopener noreferrer">collar</a>), without treating the environment, it can be difficult to keep fleas off of your cat. <br><br>Even ‘occasional’ outdoor cats require additional healthcare and vaccines to protect against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV), both of which are highly contagious and fetal.<br><br>Larimer County Law does say that in city limits all cats if outdoors must be on leash or in an enclosure of some sort. <p> </p> <h3>Declawed Cats</h3> <p>Although also used for other purposes, a cat’s claws are their main way of defending themselves. This needs considered in the discussion of indoor versus outdoor cats because it is not appropriate to allow a cat to have unsupervised outdoor time if they are fully declawed.</p> <h3>Do’s:</h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Always consider the <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/healthy-benefits-of-scratching-to-cats" title="scratching benefits">safety and health of the cat</a>.

This simply is untrue. Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years and are completely dependent on you for food, water, shelter and safety. For better understanding of your pet (Cat) Habitat visit <span style="color: #ff9900;"><a href="https://www.reference.com/pets-animals/habitat-cat-c916c24c694a51e9" style="color: #ff9900;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Habitat Indoor.</a></span></p> <p>Cats living indoors do require a little extra exercise. <br><br> There are lots of ways to make playtime feel like the thrill of being outdoors, but in the safety of your home. Many kitty toys are meant to replicate the hunting experience of the outdoors. Check out some amazing toys (see: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Track Tower, Legendog Cat Ball Toy Detachable 3 Layers Interactive Toy Track Toy for Pet Cats Kitten"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MUQn2n" target="_blank" title="cat toys" rel="noopener noreferrer">Track Tower, Legendog Cat Ball Toy Detachable 3 Layers Interactive Toy Track Toy for Pet Cats Kitten</a>)</span> for your feline available at online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a></p> <p>Many cats enjoy watching the outdoors from the warmth and safety of a windowsill. You can even buy or build a soft windowsill shelf for this purpose. Just be sure the screen is secure if you leave your window open.</p> <h2>A Safe Way For Outdoors</h2> <p>Sometimes you can give your cat a taste of the outdoor life in a safe way. You can teach your cat to walk on a leash, or give your cat a safe enclosed outdoor space to explore.</p> <p>If you decide to leash-train your cat, you’ll need proper equipment like a collar, harness, leash and some patience.</p> <h2>All Cats Need Safety Place</h2> <p>Whether your cat stays indoors or goes outside, these safety precautions can make a big difference in your cat’s health and your peace of mind:</p> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul> <li> <strong>Cat-proof their environment</strong> - Keep all poisonous plants and materials out of reach.</li> <li> <strong>Regular vaccinations</strong> - Annual vaccinations will help ward off parasites and rabies, distemper and feline leukemia.</li> <li> <strong>A breakaway or elastic collar</strong> - Even indoor cats get out sometimes—be sure your cat has collar and <a href="https://amzn.to/2nFBUga" target="_blank" title="Legendog 25PCS Dog Collar Tag Novelty No Engraving Pet ID Tag Pet Personalized Tag for Cats Dogs " rel="noopener noreferrer">ID tag</a> so you can be reached should they get lost.</li> </ul> </div> <ul></ul> <h2>Health Problems Of Outdoor Cats</h2> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image008_4fe5b3c0-86c8-4e25-aa2c-6a49d85e03fe_large.jpg?v=1526021849" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></h3> <h3>Parasites:</h3> <p>Parasites such as lungworm and heartworm are also prevalent in outdoor cats and more endemic in some areas of the country more than others. Many of these cats suffer from a cough, but the damage done to the lungs can be life-threatening in some cats.</p> <h3>Fleas and Other Ectoparasites :<strong> </strong> </h3> <p>Fleas are also the biggest source of tapeworms and can transmit blood parasites. If your cat goes outside, I believe in treating fleas proactively every month. House cats can also get fleas from other animals who go out, from hunting rodents in the house or by spending time near outdoor areas. Talk to your veterinarian about risk and prevention.</p> <h3>Trauma:</h3> <p>An outside cat is at great risk for trauma. They face wild predators, other cats and vehicles. They get caught in fences, locked up in garages or outbuildings, fall from high places.</p> <h3>Vomiting:</h3> <p>Just like our house cats, outdoor cats can suffer from many diseases and syndromes that cause vomiting, not to mention the fact that they are at <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/hazards-to-look-out-for-when-having-a-cat" title="hazards to cats">risk for eating many disgusting or toxic things</a>.</p> <h3>Rabies.</h3> <p>All cats, even indoor cats, should be vaccinated against rabies, which is now seen more commonly in cats than in any other domestic animal. Rabies is a viral illness that is transmitted through bite wounds from infected animals and attacks the nervous system. If your cat bites anyone, you may need to show proof of rabies vaccination.</p> <h3>Bottom Line :</h3> <p>Outdoor cats are at greater risk of many different problems simply because they have more exposure to them. Not every problem can be prevented. Accidents, viruses and other situations can be risky business to your cat’s health. But by being armed with knowledge and preventative care you can decrease the risks of the Big Outside.</p> <h2>Health Problems Of Indoor Cats</h2> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.petful.com/pet-health/medical-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image010_339851b0-074f-43b6-91c8-9fbdc2ad123f_grande.jpg?v=1526023455" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a></p> <h3>Kidney Failure:</h3> <br><br>Many house cats develop <a href="https://www.petful.com/pet-health/medical-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kidney disease and failure</a>, particularly as they age. Kidney disease is more prevalent in our felines than in our other pets.<br><br>The most common cause of kidney disease and failure in cats is age. Not every older cat has kidney disease, however, and younger cats can be affected.<br><br>Exposure to toxins that damage the kidneys, infections, dehydration, poor diet and stress on the body caused by other illnesses can all affect the kidneys. Congenital kidney disease and cancer also occur.<br><br> <h3>Respiratory Diseases:</h3> <br>Cats are frequently plagued by diseases that cause anything from a mild sneeze to respiratory distress. Symptoms include runny nose and sneezing, tearing eyes, ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, cough, fever or difficulty breathing.<br><br><a href="https://www.petful.com/pet-health/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper respiratory disease</a> is often caused by viruses. Bacterial infections can come secondarily. Theses infections can be mild and self-limiting, chronic or sporadic, or serious. Kittens, geriatric and immunocompromised kitties are at greater risk of developing serious respiratory infections.<br><br> <h3>Vomiting:</h3> <p>Will commonly vomit from time to time, often because they might have eaten something that upset their stomachs, or simply because they have sensitive digestive systems. However, the condition becomes acute when the vomiting does not stop and when there is nothing left in the cat's stomach to throw up except bile. </p> <h3> <br>Lower Urinary Tract Problems:<strong> </strong> </h3> <p>Disease of the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) is a very common problem in cats and may be due to a single or, more commonly, a combination of factors.</p> <p>These include:</p> <ul> <li>Idiopathies (unknown causes)</li> <li><a href="http://www.pethealthnetwork.com/cat-health/bladder-stones-cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urinary crystals or stones</a></li> <li>Bacteria and other microbes (viral, fungal), which cause urinary tract infections (UTIs)</li> <li>Anatomic or neurologic abnormalities</li> <li>Cancer</li> <li>Stress may also play a role in some cats.</li> </ul> <p>Whatever the underlying cause, the symptoms are the same as the cat’s lower urinary tract responds in a similar and predictable way: inflammation and the pain that goes with it. Unfortunately, cats are not complainers and often instinctually hide their discomfort, making it difficult to see that they are sick. There are, however, some tell-tale signs that your pet has a lower urinary tract problem.</p> <h3>Dermatologic Disease :</h3> <p>Cats are very prone to allergies that cause itchy skin, particularly <a href="https://www.petful.com/pet-health/cat-has-allergies-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flea allergic dermatitis</a>.</p> <p>Indoor cats can get fleas. Most veterinary dermatologists believe flea allergy is behind a great deal of cat scratching until proven otherwise. <br> Cats can also be allergic to inside and outside environmental allergens and be food allergic. When a cat is itchy, they will over-groom, bite, scratch and give themselves serious skin lesions.</p> <p>There are many other dermatologic diseases in cats including parasitic, neoplastic, bacterial, fungal, autoimmune and inflammatory.</p> <br> <h3>Bottom Line :</h3> <p>Many diseases are common to cats can be prevented in two ways first, by keeping your cat indoors, and by having your cat vaccinated according to your veterinarian's advice.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
