We'll break it down into funny and interesting cat behavior facts.</p> <h3><span style="color: #660000;"><strong>Cat Behavior Facts</strong></span></h3> <p>There are lots of quirky things cats will do to say "hi!" They will rub against you, jump a little to reach you, sniff your face, and make chirping sounds. We have a cat who insists on nibbling our heads from the back of the couch. And another who drools- a lot. We will explore all kinds of unique and quirky cat behavior facts. They are really interesting, well here are <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-behavior-and-psychology" title="scratching behavior">some of their behaviors</a> we must understand.</p> <p><br><br></p> <h2><strong style="color: #cc0000;"><em>Body Language</em></strong></h2> <p><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/cat-language_large.png?v=1532389852" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">There are lots of cat behavior facts that are tied in to their body. Some of the things that come to mind are tail twitching, hair on the back rising, and a lot can be said by a cat through the position of his ears. You can even learn about your cats emotions by looking into his eyes! Learn all about your cats body language, and you'll know at a glance how he is feeling. You may also want to check <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/knowing-your-cats-mood" title="cat mood">Knowing Your Cats Moods</a> for more ideas in understanding them.<br><br>We can see and hear how they talk using only these gestures:</p> <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong style="color: #f6b26b;"><span style="color: #000000;">1.</span> Sounds</strong></h4> <ol></ol> <ul> <li> <strong>Trilling</strong> – sound between “meow and Purr”, somehow a greeting gesture.</li> <li> <strong>Chirping</strong> – for hunting skill, makes you giggle at the sound they make.</li> <li> <strong>Yowling</strong> - a cross between yodel and howling, sometimes an irritating sound, used also in mating.</li> <li> <strong>Hissing and growling</strong> – never a good sign, they only used it in times of danger, like they are furious or frightened.</li> <li> <strong>Soundless meowing</strong> - a sign of exhaustion or hunger and dehydration</li> <li> <strong>Purring</strong> - definite sign of your kitty’s happiness and affection.</li> </ul> <p>**However, in some cases, <strong>abnormal purring</strong> can be a sign your <strong>cat is in pain</strong>, so if you notice their purring is out of the ordinary, take them to a vet for a checkup.</p> <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #f6b26b;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">2.</span> Body</strong></span></h4> <ul> <li><strong>Lying on their back, belly exposed</strong></li> </ul> <p>Your cat completely trusts you and feels comfortable enough to reveal their most vulnerable area to you. On the other hand, there is a 99% percent chance you’ll get your hand scratched if you dare go for a belly rub. I know, it’s a trap that few people can resist.</p> <p>But If your cat growls while lying on their back, they’re agitated and ready to strike.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Arched back</strong></li> </ul> <p>Cuddling time! If a cat gets near you and arches their back, they’re trying to tell you to pet them.</p> <p>Arched back in combination with bristled hair means your cat is frightened or angry.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rubbing against you</strong></li> </ul> <p>Even though most people think this means their kitty is feeling affectionate, the real reason for rubbing is a bit more complex. Cats rub against things (or people) to mark their territory. This is especially true when they rub their cheeks at something, because of the glands located there that release special (territorial) pheromones. But hey, at least your kitty is claiming you!</p> <ul> <li><strong>Kneading</strong></li> </ul> <p>Every time a cat kneads it’s a remnant of their kittenhood<span> </span>memories. Cats knead only special people, and only when they’re particularly happy and content. Be proud if a kitty wants to knead on your lap!</p> <ul> <li><strong>Butt wiggling</strong></li> </ul> <p>Nope, your kitty is probably not the biggest fan of an artist that has the word Dogg in their name. The funny and cute butt wiggling is a precursor to pouncing and it’s one of the many cat body language signs connected to stalking prey.</p> <h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong style="color: #f6b26b;"><span style="color: #000000;">3.</span> Ears and Eyes and Tail</strong></h4> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://d20suvt5sog3wj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ourfriends4ever_cat_eyes_body_language.jpg?x10150" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <ol start="2"></ol> <p>Now, we have mastered and familiarized all the subtle art of distinguishing between the different sounds and body movements our cats make, and try to understand their body language (see: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Total Cat Mojo: The Ultimate Guide to Life with Your Cat - Paperback"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MY1gRh" target="_blank" title="cat mojo book" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Cat Mojo: The Ultimate Guide to Life with Your Ca</a>t </span><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"The Well Cat Book: The Classic Comprehensive Handbook of Cat Care Reissue Edition - Kindle Edition"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'> - Amazon)</span>. Learning how to make sense of their movements and gestures, when it comes to deciphering cat body language, it’s not all written on their face. In reality, their faces and facial gestures can reveal just a small fraction of their thoughts. </p> <p>Here are some examples that can help you better understand cat behavior:</p> <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #bf9000;">Ears</span></h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Slightly forward</strong> - feeling curious and playful, can often be spotted while they’re checking out a new toy</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Straight and upright</strong> - Something got your cat’s attention, it means something alerted them</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pinned back, flat</strong> - often accompanied by hissing or growling, and it indicates that your cat is either furious (probably at you) or frightened.</p> </li> </ul> <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #bf9000;">Eyes</span></h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Slowly blinking</strong> - air kisses of the feline world, simply means that your cat adores you.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dilated pupils</strong> - a sure sign of feline excitement, however, if combined with defensive or aggressive gestures or sounds, big, wide pupils can mean your cat is scared.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Slit (constricted) pupils</strong> - A look of annoyance.</p> </li> </ul> <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #bf9000;">Tail</span></h5> <ul> <li> <p style="float: left;"><strong>Tail</strong> - Cat tail language, the matters are much more complex than to the dogs.</p> </li> <li> <p style="float: left;"><strong><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/7523947_orig_large.png?v=1532389529" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Cat wagging tail</strong> - Your kitty is seriously frustrated with you. If you’re wondering why cats flick their tail when you’re trying to pet them, watch out, because otherwise it might take a few scratches to clear things up.<br><br><strong>Cat tail twitching</strong> - milder version of wagging, twitching often means that the cat is only flicking the tip of their tail and it indicates a playful mood. If you see a cat chasing its tail, you can be sure that they started twitching it first.<br><br><strong>Puffed up tail</strong> - a fluffy, puffed up tail is not one of the positive cat tail signs. It means that your kitty is terrified of something, or, if accompanied by hissing, preparing to attack.<br><br><strong>Tucked away</strong> - it’s a sign of anxiety and submission. When something makes your cat nervous, like a new environment or a new family member, they’ll tuck away their tail</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curved tail</strong> - When a cat curves their tail in a shape similar to question mark, it means that they’re ready to explore and play! If you’ve been waiting to introduce them to that new toy you got them, now is the perfect time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Embracing tail</strong> - A cat that curves its tail all around them, creating a cute, fluffy embrace is a happy, satisfied one. Cats can even embrace other cats with their tails, giving them a warm, feline hug.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <h2><strong style="color: #cc0000;"><em>Sleeping Cats</em></strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/7_fc0d046e-b933-4b09-ad69-3beac4c5f8ba_large.jpg?v=1532392015" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Cats sleep almost more than any other mammal! They set a record at a whopping 16 hours per day of sleep. No wonder we coined the term "cat nap!". Sometimes it's said that cats are nocturnal. It can seem that way when a cat is up at all hours of the night. Actually, they are most active at dawn and dusk. That's when their prey is most active, so that's when they are hard-wired to go out and hunt.</p> <p>Also, cats can't actually see in the pitch-dark. They need a little moonlight or nightlight, and then their eyes will adjust to help then see. But if there is complete darkness, they can't see.</p> <h4><span style="color: #f9cb9c;">Here are some facts that cats sleeps:</span></h4> <ul> <li><strong>Long Sleeping Hours</strong></li> <li><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/9_a0e70d51-1ac7-4a1f-9ad2-9bc45c57c877_large.jpg?v=1532392159" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></li> <li> <li>Don’t be alarmed if your cat sleeps a lot. It’s actually perfectly normal and healthy for a cat to sleep for 16-20 hours per day! </li> <li> <li>Cats who spend the most time sleeping are generally either very young (<a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/meowing-kittens" title="meowing kittens">new kittens</a>) or elderly.<br><br> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Eye Movement</strong></p> <p>Just like you, your cat experiences both non-REM and REM sleep. You’ll know your cat is in deep REM sleep (and dreaming!) when you see her body or face twitch.<br><br></p> </li> <li><strong>Alert While Still Asleep</strong></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <strong><br><em><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/sleeping-cats-9_large.jpg?v=1532395404" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></em></strong>Cats are hardwired to be able to fight or flee at a moment’s notice, even when they’re sleeping. If you’ve ever touched your cat while she was deep in twitchy REM sleep, you may have noticed how quickly she’s able to spring to action with complete alertness, ready to defend herself and her territory. <ul></ul> <ul> <li><strong>Daytime Sleep</strong></li> </ul> Your cat’s wildcat ancestors slept all day so they could hunt all night. Your cat’s sharp sense of hearing paired with her ability to see clearly in very dim light gives her a huge advantage over her prey once the sun goes down. Though cats can be trained to adhere to a schedule more in line with your own, they’re naturally nocturnal. <ul></ul> <ul> <li><strong>Conserving Energy</strong></li> </ul> Sleeping a lot helps your cat conserve energy, making it easier for her to spring into action at the first sign of play or prey. <ul></ul> <ul> <li><strong>Weather affects their Sleeping Habit</strong></li> </ul> Do you get sleepy when the weather is rainy? So does your cat! If you start paying attention, you’ll probably find that your cat spends a larger chunk of her day snoozing when it’s rainy or cold out. <ul></ul> <ul> <li><strong>Snoring</strong></li> </ul> <div style="float: left;"> <img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/8_d70fdf63-e3f1-412e-8e12-bef4353d9d29_large.jpg?v=1532392165" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br><br> </div> Your cat can snore, just like you. It’s often the result of the position she’s laying in or a partial obstruction of her airway. Some breeds, such as Persians and <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-breed-spotlight-the-himalayan" title="himalayan cat">Himalayans</a>, are more prone to snoring than other breeds since their smooshed faces often produce respiratory issues. <br><br>Don’t worry about your cat’s snoring unless you notice other signs of respiratory distress, such as open-mouth breathing, she’s extending her neck and head, sneezing or coughing, producing a nasal discharge, or if her voice has changed. It’s time for a vet visit if you notice any of these signs. <ul></ul> <p>Their cuteness overload doesn’t seem to stop us from loving them. Here are some of their <strong>qualities that catches our hearts</strong>:</p> <strong>Loving and Caring</strong> – they are giving trust to us, and showing them through expressing them in a body language<br><br><strong>Curious</strong> – they are curious little fellow, they want to know everything. As we are describing them as territorial behavior.<br><br><strong>Playful</strong> – They love to play especially with toys made just for them. It’s like an exercise for them and also to kill boredom. Like the one we got for him in <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a>.<br><br><strong>Cuddly, Cute and Adorable</strong> - Cats are a lot like people. Some are warm and cuddly, others are more reserved. Some are smart, some are funny, some are fighters, some are lovers.<br><br><strong>Adventurous ,Silly and Goofy</strong> – They like to play all around our house, sometimes we can find them under our couch or beds. Peeking at you like a pirate going in their ship. <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/30-Funny-Cats-Pictures-21-5-700x437_large.jpg?v=1532396440" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <br><br><strong>Funny, Smart and Intelligent</strong> – Cats demonstrate different types of intelligence through hunting, problem solving, memory, protection and training.<br><br><strong>Friendly and Affectionate</strong> – Based on new research from Oregon State University, there is a scientific evidence that cats are, according to empirical study, nice. In fact, the study concluded, cats like interacting with humans more than they like eating food. Yes, more than food.The motivation for the study was to apply cognitive tests that have already be tried out on dogs and tortoises on cats, in order to clear up some misconceptions around cats' bad reputation for being unsociable.<br><br><strong>Sleepy and Happy</strong><br><b><br></b><strong>Agile and Stretchy</strong> - As predators who pounce and chase their prey, cats evolved in such a way as to give them an extra-long stride, the ability to run almost 30 mph for short bursts, and the ability to jump as much as nine times their height from a standing position. Those evolutionary adaptations also gave them the ability to land on their feet (almost) all the time when they fall.<br> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <p> </p> <h4><span style="color: #f6b26b;">Body Flexibility</span></h4> <p style="float: left;"><strong><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/10_c09a6fa1-417c-452f-8101-00224ca6bba4_large.jpg?v=1532392153" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></strong></p> <p>Cats can jump up to nine times their height from a standing start. Their extreme flexibility also makes it easy for them to <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/importance-of-cleanliness-in-cats" title="importance of cleanliness in cats">clean all parts of their body</a>, thus eliminating any odors that might cause them to be detected by other cats, larger predators, and potential prey.</p> <p>Another factor in cats' flexibility is that their shoulder blades are attached to the rest of the body only by muscles. Humans and dogs shoulder blades, on the other hand, form part of the joint that connects the upper arm or foreleg to the body. This allows cats to extend their running stride even more. Their loosely attached shoulder blades, along with tiny rudimentary collar bones, also allow them to squeeze into tiny spaces. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
