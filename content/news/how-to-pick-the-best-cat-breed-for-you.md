It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail.</p> <p>Its body is moderately long, with substantial boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The chest is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost as wide as chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to its body. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and the side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape, with size proportionate to its head. <br><br>Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.</p> <ul></ul> <p>If you’ve always wanted a dog in a cat’s body, the American Bobtail is the breed for you. He is <strong>easygoing</strong>, <strong>affectionate</strong> and <strong>adaptable</strong>. Whether you live in a noisy home with lots of kids and other pets or have a more quiet lifestyle, he will settle in quickly. It’s not unusual to find him traveling with long-distance truck drivers or people seeing the country in their RV. <br><br>Some <strong>psychotherapists</strong> have included American Bobtails in their <strong>treatment programs</strong> because of the <strong>cats’ sensitivity to human emotions</strong>.</p> <strong><em><br><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image007_747db668-1d1c-4310-9390-f5276010faeb_large.jpg?v=1522650638" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><span style="color: #e06666;">Balinese</span></em></strong><em> - </em>The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. <br><br>The coat is basically medium-length (although there can be considerable variance by individual) and is soft and silky, without the fluffy undercoat typical of most long-haired breeds. <br><br>According to CFA, FIFe, GCCF standards Balinese and Siamese should be alike, except for their fur length. The fur is average length, thin, silky and snug without underfur; it gradually becomes longer from the head towards the tail. The longest fur is on cat’s tail. Balinese cat color is colorpoint. <br><br>Points are cat’s body areas which have bright and intense fur color: ears, “mask” on the head, limbs bottom and tail. All other body parts – usually this is cat’s body should be maximally bright and contrast clearly with the points. A light tint of points color is allowed on the cat’s abdomen. “Mask” on the head completely covers the whole cat’s face, including whiskers bottom and it touches the ears, but it doesn’t merge .The “mask” shouldn’t become a “hood” and expand towards the head occipital lobe. The points on all body parts should be uniformly colored and of one color. In the points area there should be no white spots or separate white hairs. Adult Balinese cats’ fur tends to get darker through the whole body. Experts shut their eyes to this.<br> <ul></ul> <p>Balinese cat <strong>isn’t a lap cat</strong>, so it won’t be just a decoration in your house. These are <strong>very active cats</strong>, <strong>clever</strong>, <strong>brave with well developed predatory drive</strong>. They won’t feel comfortable in a small flat, they need some space to run, jump and climb. So, if there is no special cat climbing frame in the house, then closets, shelves and wall carpets will be used for this purpose. <br><br>At the same time Balinese cats are very affectionate and sociable. Balinese are <strong>very talkative and musical</strong> – these cats don’t yell like other cats do, they “<strong>talk</strong>” in <strong>different tones</strong> and tell their story. Their favorite thing is to sit on a windowsill and “comment” everything that is going on outside. Just listen to them!<br><br></p> <strong><em><br><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image009_large.jpg?v=1522650678" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><span style="color: #e06666;">Bombay</span></em></strong> <em>- </em>Except for his dramatic black coat, the Bombay <strong>looks much like the Burmese</strong>, but with a few physical differences such as a larger, longer body and longer legs. He has a rounded head with medium-size ears set wide apart, eyes that range in color from gold to copper, and a straight, medium-length tail. The short, fine coat feels satiny to the touch and shines like patent leather. <br><br>Although the gene for the black coat is dominant, a sable-colored kitten is sometimes born in a Bombay litter. Some associations permit these kittens to be registered as Burmese. <br><br>The Bombay is a medium-size cat; when lifted, he feels heftier than he looks. The breed develops slowly and males may not reach full size and musculature until they are 2 years old.<br> <ul></ul> <p>The lively and affectionate Bombay loves people and is <strong>adaptable to many</strong> different <strong>environments and lifestyles</strong>. His calm nature makes him a good apartment dweller, and he is amenable to life with other pets, although he definitely wants to be top cat. Expect to find the Bombay hogging the warmest spot in the house. That includes under the covers at bedtime. Most will converse with their people in a distinctive but not loud voice. <br><br>Bombay cats are often <strong>good at playing fetch</strong>, and some have <strong>learned to walk on leash</strong>. This is a <strong>smart cat who loves to play</strong> and will thrive with a family who is willing to teach him tricks, play games with him and provide him with plenty of interactive toys, like the ones I got from <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>.<br><br></p> <div style="float: right;"><em><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image011_large.jpg?v=1522650714" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br></strong></span></em></div> <span style="color: #e06666;"><strong><em>Maine Coon</em> </strong></span>- Maine Coons are a <strong>large breed</strong> of cats and is a <strong>native New Englander</strong>, hailing from Maine, where he was a <strong>popular mouser</strong>, <strong>farm cat</strong> and, most likely, <strong>ship’s cat back in the days</strong>. A telltale sign of the Maine Coon cat is their fur. <br><br>It is very thick and medium to long, and they have tufts of fur on their paws as well as that long silky coat with the thick under coat, built for just such work the harsh climate of Main (hence the name). <br><br>They <strong>have rectangular bodies</strong> and they ta<strong>ke about 4 years to reach full maturity</strong>. They have a “<strong>ruff</strong>” <strong>around the neck that is discernible</strong>, and they have <strong>large paws</strong> as well. <br><br>Large, well-tufted ears are wide at the base, tapering to a point, and large, expressive eyes are green, gold, greenish-gold or copper. White or bi-colored Maine Coons may have blue or odd eyes. The brown tabby pattern is so common in this breed that many people don’t know Maine Coons can come in any other colors or patterns, such as black, red or white, all tabby colors and patterns, bi-color such as blue and white or red and white.<br> <ul></ul> <ul> <li>He l<strong>ikes being with people</strong> and has the <strong>habit of following them around</strong>, but he <strong>isn’t needy.</strong> <br><br> </li> <li>He’s <strong>happy to receive attention</strong> when you direct it his way, but if you’re busy he’s satisfied to just supervise your doings. <br><br> </li> <li>He’s <strong>not typically a lap cat</strong>, but he does like to be near you. <br><br> </li> <li>He also retains his skill as a <strong>mouser</strong>. No rodents will be safe in a home where a Maine Coon resides. Even if you don’t have any mice for him to chase, he’ll keep his skills sharp by chasing toys and grabbing them with his big paws. A Maine Coon also enjoys playing fetch and will retrieve small balls, toys or wadded-up pieces of paper. <br><br> </li> <li>He’s also very smart and will happily learn tricks or play with <a href="https://amzn.to/2MVLXbP" target="_blank" title="cat toys" rel="noopener noreferrer">puzzle toys</a> that challenge his brain. Maine Coons usually enjoy a kittenish love of play well into adulthood. <strong>Males</strong>, especially, are <strong>prone to silly behavior</strong>. <strong>Females</strong> are <strong>more dignified</strong>, but they aren’t above a good game of chase. Not especially vocal, they make any requests in a soft chirp or trill.</li> </ul> <p>The friendly, laid back Maine Coon is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. <br><br></p> <ul> <li>He loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect, and he doesn’t mind playing dress-up or going for a ride in a baby buggy. <br><br> </li> <li>He is happy to live with cat-friendly dogs, too, thanks to his amiable disposition.</li> </ul> <p>So far, these are the cats that I currently have at my home which I reared up since they were a few days old. I love them all, of course, sometimes I get angry with them if they did something wrong, but hey, it is not healthy for a relationship not to experience bad situations like that, right?</p> <p>Here's also for you to look the how-to guide in having a cat as a pet (<a href="https://amzn.to/2MWc6XN" target="_blank" title="cat care book" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Total Cat Mojo: The Ultimate Guide to Life with Your Cat Kindle Edition"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'>Total Cat Mojo: The Ultimate Guide to Life with Your Cat Kindle Edition</span> in AMAZON</a>) that's my secret.
