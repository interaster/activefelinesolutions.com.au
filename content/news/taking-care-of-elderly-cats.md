<p>All of us grow old, and your pets are no exception. Your cat might not show graying of their entire fur or wrinkling of their skin but just like us, cats also show signs of deterioration and health conditions that are very similar to humans. As your cat enters this stage of their life, they’ll need some extra understanding for their changing lifestyle. Cats are typically considered as a senior when they reach around 12 years of age and there are lots of simple yet basic steps you can take to ensure the golden years of your cat’s life are comfortable and happy. You will be rewarded with a satisfied pet, who is often happy to spend much time quietly at home as a marvelous companion.</p> <h4><span style="color: #990000;">Here are the usual signs that tells you that your cat has already reached its golden years:</span></h4> <ul> <li> <p>Becoming more inactive and muscle tone reduces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Significant change in its eating and drinking (water) habits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hearing and vision deteriorates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Changes in its bowel and urinary habits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weakened immune system.</p> </li> <li> <p>The tendency to sleep more than the usual.</p> </li> <li> <p>Coat gets duller and less shinier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Age-associated disorders may develop, such as arthritis, hyperthyroidism, overactive thyroid, intestinal problems, sometimes cancer, pancreatitis, diabetes, and renal disease.</p> </li> <li> <p>Psychological and behavioral changes can occur, such as senility, aggression, increased dependence, becoming emotionally distant or especially needy, restlessness or waking at night or becoming more talkative due to Feline Cognitive Decline (FCD).</p> </li> <li> <p>May tend to "forget" on using their <a href="https://amzn.to/2KAR5W1" target="_blank" title="cat litter box" rel="noopener noreferrer">litter box</a></p> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p>A lot of cat owners see this process as normal and feel that there is nothing that they can do for their cat aside from giving medications to ease the pain if their cat have some sort of illness, and others worry about discussing the signs that they have noticed on their cat and they fear that the vet will say it’s serious or that the cat may need to be euthanized. Nevertheless, these concerns are often untrue and your vet is more than happy to help you wherever they can. Always talk to your vet to discuss any issues that your cat may have. And also, it is crucial to take your senior cat to see the vet routinely to guarantee that they are not suffering or hiding any illness. As a cat owner, you want to make sure that they are problem-free and to enjoy their later years free of trouble.</p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"> Preventive Medicine Countermeasures</span></h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image004_9dbddccc-64db-4318-aa0d-0b60317ee703_medium.jpg?v=1525942267" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">It is essential for a senior cat to be regularly taken to the vet and have a regular health check for they compared to younger cats, healthier cats, especially if they have ailments or diseases due to their old age. Your vet will give you advise on how often they need to be seen and many surgeries now run special ‘geriatric’ clinics. Regular weight checks are also important, as it is one basic way to tell if your cat's health declines or not, and also, to keep up regular booster vaccinations because cats’ immune systems can weaken with age.<br><br><br><br><br></p> <h4><span style="color: #f6b26b;"><br><br>Feeding</span></h4> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;">T<img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/finicky-cat-new_medium.jpg?v=1525942639" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">here is a variety of senior diets available in your local pet supply store or supermarket that provides balanced nutrition specifically designed for senior cats. Always provide fresh water for your cat and ensure that they have easy access to it, preferably a pet water dispenser placed in several locations around the house, including upstairs and downstairs (and also on spots where they usually hang out). Provide smaller meals little and often. Keep an eye on cat’s appetite closely as this can decrease or increase at any given time, depending on a variety of health factors. There is also a possibility that their appetite may decrease once their sense of smell dwindle, and one way to overcome this is to warm up the food, thus diffusing the gas particles on their food with the air, which will increase the smell and boosts appetite.

They can tell you on any specific, individual concerns and may suggest diagnostic tests to be run first or recommend your for other alternatives to the procedure.

It causes changes that are associated with the inflammation and loss of the deep supporting structures of the cat’s teeth.

However, with the help of various treatments, affected cats can often maintain a good quality of life for several months or years.</p> <h4> <br><span style="color: #e69138;">Arthritis</span> </h4> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/cat-arthritis-935950_medium.jpg?v=1525942881" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Also known as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, is a disease that causes pain and inflammation in a cat’s joints. Arthritis is extremely common in cats and tends to affect the elbow joint when it does strike, and sometimes, other joints can be afflicted as well.
