<p>Cats were been part of our lives and history way back from the Egyptian Regime. They were once considered or worshiped as one of the gods. Until today, we still live together with them, whether they were from the wild or within our homes. As we all know mostly of their behaviors and personalities, we can understand them. </p> <p>Cats are adorable creatures and we tend to take care of them. Giving all their needs, and love them as well. Even we take good care of them, sometimes we just can’t avoid accidents and circumstances that might lead our cats in trouble.<br><br> There is one question that run in our minds, believing that they have extra lives. Do we really believe that cats have nine lives? Some of us might heard that cats have nine lives, but is this a Fact or a Myth? In this article, we can tackle some of our questions that can lead to an answer.</p> <h2> <br><strong>Why Nine Lives ?</strong> </h2> <p><strong><br>An old English proverb states</strong> "A cat has nine lives. For three he plays, for three he strays, and for the last three he stays". This could be where the myth that cats have nine lives came from- though the proverb is not thought to be meant in seriousness.</p> <p>It's a statement about the hardy nature of cats and the fact that they give the most love when they are old- too old to chase mice and run away! Time goes by , some of us witnessed cats survive in situations that surely would have severely injured other animals.</p> <p>Some people likely began to believe that cats must have multiple lives.Nine is also a magic number- and this could be partly why cats are attributed with having nine lives, because they have been both worshipped and feared throughout the ages for being magical. The ancient Greeks said that the number nine referred to the trinity of all trinities- and is a mystic number which invokes tradition and religion.

Though we cannot say that cats always land on their feet, they indeed always. No surprise—it helps them to survive when falling.</p> <h3>Amortization of Falls</h3> <p>Helps them survive. It would be no use to land on feet if legs were made of concrete. But what if they were made of springs? Then they would take most of the impact away from the body and internal organs. Cats don’t have springs, but their <strong>ability to flex their joints</strong> (and to time it extremely well) is the next best thing.</p> <h3>Relatively Slow Maximal Falling Velocity</h3> <p>(Known as “<strong>terminal velocity</strong>” in physics) also contributes to how cats survive falls, and quite often extremely high falls. When terminal velocity has been reached, it does not really matter how long it takes to reach the ground. The basic physics supporting terminal velocity explain that large, but light objects (e.g. balloons)will fall slower than small, but heavy objects (e.g. bricks). In general, <strong>smaller mammals have slower terminal velocity</strong>, which is good for cats since they are relatively small. Of course, this relatively slow terminal velocity is useless by itself without righting reflex and soft landing.<br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Do You Still Believe That Cats Have Nine Lives?</strong></h2> <p> <br><br></p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image006_77395343-40d9-4e83-9a8d-4c4baf966533_medium.jpg?v=1526366986" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p> <h3>Facts About Cats</h3> All cats have their <strong>own personalities</strong>. Just ask anyone who has ever been "owned" by more than one cat! The pets can be holy terrors or angelic little pussycats.<br><br>All members of the feline species share some traits, however, and they all have to do with survival.<br><br> <h3>Physical Traits:</h3> <p>Some <strong>physical traits common</strong> to all cats, both big and small, have to do with their <strong>survival and way of life</strong>. All cats, including lions and tigers, have <strong>sandpaper tongues</strong>. Since cats are carnivores, nature has given them certain gifts to help them with their survival. The rough tongue acts like a steel wool pad to scrape all the meat off the bones of the hapless critter, be it a mouse or a moose, the cat is having for lunch.</p> <p>All cats, with the exception of the cheetah, come fully equipped with retractable claws. They also come with night-vision goggles in the form of those beautiful green or blue eyes that have more rods and cones than humans do. Cats' eyes all have a tapetum lucidum, which causes their eyes to glow in the dark.<br><br></p> <h3>Special Skills:<br><br> </h3> <p>All cats are <strong>good hunters</strong>. Some may not want to hunt, but that doesn't mean they can't if forced to survive. Every cat, from the mighty lion to the mini-munchkin, has the ability to catch and kill prey. The only difference is the size of the prey.</p> <p>Also, cats are very flexible; even the most talented Olympic gymnast cannot curl, stretch, twist, roll and jump like every healthy, normal cat can. The Cat Fanciers' Association lists 42 distinct of Cat breeds and there are almost as many coat types, colors and patterns. All cats have the ability to shed their coats in summer and grow it thicker in winter.</p> <p>All cats have the ability to hide their pain and suffering very well. All cats, with the exception of the big cats, can purr, though they all have different reasons for doing it. Even the medium cats -- bobcats, <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-breed-spotlight-the-ocicat" title="Cat Breed Spotlight - Ocicats ">ocelots</a></strong> and lynxes, for example -- purr.<br><br></p> <h3>Special Needs:<br><br> </h3> <p>All cats have a particular set of needs to be<strong> happy and healthy</strong>. <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-nutrition" title="cat nutrition">Cats all need an amino acid called taurine to survive</a></strong>. Therefore, all cats share the trait of never being able to join the vegetarian society.</p> <p>Taurine is only found in animal products and cannot be manufactured artificially. Most mammals can make their own taurine from other amino acids, but cats cannot. Without taurine, cats can suffer heart failure or blindness.</p> <p>Cats also <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2KAR5W1" target="_blank" title="litter box" rel="noopener noreferrer">need to bury their feces and urine</a></strong>. Even cats in the wild do so to hide their presence in case any bigger predators get any ideas. Even the big cats cover their solid waste. Cats are the only animals that are both prey and predator.<br><br></p> <h3>Cool Facts:<br><br> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image007_89d3d4dc-158a-4033-a135-d9ec79b9aadf_large.jpg?v=1526367153" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br>All cats have scent glands on their paws, faces and foreheads. They also all have the same greeting. They sniff one another's noses, then they kind of bump flanks, and finally they turn and present their anal opening to the other cat in a gesture of "Yes, yes, get to know me a little better."<br><br>Many cat owners report their cats are always doing that to them and they don't know why. Their kitties are just communicating the way all cats do. Cat personalities vary greatly, but personality traits shared by all cats are their independent natures, <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/importance-of-cleanliness-in-cats" title="importance of cleanliness in cats">cleanliness habits</a></strong> and the ability to be aloof and very, very quiet when necessary.<br><br>All cats lift their tails high in the air when being friendly or happy, and will sway their tails slowly back and forth when processing fear, anxiety or anger.

A pet that spends more time outdoors may live on average 2 to 3 years less than a cat that lives exclusively indoors. In addition, <strong>unexpected accidents may end an outdoor cat's life at any time</strong>.<br><br>Stray and <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds%EF%BB%BF" title="australian breeds">feral cats</a></strong> live significantly less. On average, a stray cat lives 5 years if he is in a community of cats and 2 to 3 years if he lives by himself. This is due to unbalanced nutrition and lack of veterinary treatment and vaccinations. In addition, feral cats may get killed while fighting other wild animals.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Indoor Cats:<br><br> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://pets.thenest.com/whats-normal-indoor-cat-lifespan-10139.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image012_68f6670c-8271-4928-abb2-d5fe33283716_medium.jpg?v=1526367264" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a><br>If a cat resides indoors exclusively, the typical lifespan ranges somewhere between 13 and 17 years, according to the Research.<br><br>However, it isn't uncommon for indoor cats to live to at least 20.

Hazardous weather won't imperil her. She won't be snatched up by a stranger. She probably won't catch an infectious disease -- such as rabies or the feline leukemia virus -- from a stray or feral cat.<br><br></p> <h2>Preventing Accident</h2> <p><strong>Cats don’t have nine lives</strong>, and no one knows this better than a veterinarian.<br><br></p> <h3>Common Injuries:<br><strong><br></strong> </h3> <ul> <li>Soft-tissue trauma — bruise or contusion</li> <li>Lacerations or bite wounds</li> <li>Scratch or wound on the eye</li> <li>Mouth trauma or fractured tooth</li> <li>Abrasions or superficial wounds </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <h3> <br>Common Accident Accidents:<strong> </strong> </h3> We all want our cat to lead his fullest, longest life.

Playing with is OK, but many cats and kittens may move onto eating the string, yarn, thread, or other similar object which will often need to be surgically removed. Stick to <strong>toys made for cats</strong> instead of opting for a ball of yarn – we have a few suggestions in online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>.<br><br></p> <h3>Animal Aggression At Home<br><br> </h3> <ul></ul> <p>If you have more than one cat – or more than one type of animal – there is no guaranteeing that they will get along 24/7.
