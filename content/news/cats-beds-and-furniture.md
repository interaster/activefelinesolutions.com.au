<p>Many cat owners see their cat furniture as an extra - nice to have, but not really essential. Consider for a moment your cat's instinctual behavior, and then take a look around your home. Does she have a place to climb and explore different heights? <br><br>Does she have a safe place to scratch and establish territory? <br><br>Does she have opportunities to hunt? <br><br>If your furnishings and furniture are not acceptable places for her to display these behaviors, then cat furniture is an acceptable alternative - and a necessity to your cat's well-being.</p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Let Them Play</strong></span></h2> <p style="float: right;"><br><u><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/1_838b23ac-65e5-4e5a-b304-9550099d95b9_large.jpg?v=1522903158" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br><br></u>Cat Furniture is made to address the instinctual needs of cats and helps relieve the stress your cat can develop when sharing her environment with humans and other pets. Take, for instance, the need cats have to climb and seek different heights. Cat trees address this need with a design that incorporates maximum vertical range; some cat trees are constructed for floor-to-ceiling installation. <br><br>Cats can paw at toys on ground level, or go to ceiling level to examine their indoor surrounding or to get a better look out a window. Most cat furniture is assembled with posts made of carpet or sisal. These posts are no accident in design. They provide structural integrity while inviting instinctual scratching, which trims claws and leaves behind cat scent to establish territory. The need to establish territory is especially important in multiple-cat homes, and may even help prevent urine marking as a method of establishing territory. </p> <p> </p> <h2><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Exercise and Challenges</span><br> </strong></h2> <p>Though indoor cats live longer, healthier lives than outdoor cats, they face a health risk rare to most outdoor cats - a sedentary lifestyle. When cats aren't given opportunities to hunt, explore, and exercise, they risk not only excessive weight gain, but also emotional problems linked to boredom, inactivity, and lack of challenge. Our cat furniture is made to encourage activity and exercise. </p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.drsfostersmith.com/cat-supplies/furniture/trees/ps/c/3261/10345/1886"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/2_77e4481f-56a9-4b69-825f-a4e7e1f501d4_large.jpg?v=1522903233" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Many of our carpeted pieces are equipped with a breakaway toy to encourage prey-like behaviors like pouncing and swatting. Plus, multiple levels ensure cats expend energy moving from level to level and crawling in and out of cubbies. And, the cubbies or corners can also provide a hunting challenge when you hide a favorite treat or toy inside for your cat to find. <br><br>Take, for instance, the need cats have to climb and seek different heights.

Having one or several of these in your home allows your cat to play, stretch, claw, and climb to his or her heart's content. <br><br>Additionally some cat furniture items can help prevent your cat from scratching and damaging your furniture. Help fulfill your cat's need to play and scratch with some of the suggested products at <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a>. <br><br>Simply stated, cat furniture addresses the instinctual needs of cats. Within the limited confines of the indoor world, our cats' natural behaviors can often seem exaggerated or destructive. In response, we are often tempted to shoo or scold a cat for a behavior that is very normal. </p> <p><br>Cat furniture offers a place for her to vent all of these behaviors, safely and without destroying your furnishing or belongings. <br><br>Cat Furniture lets your cat climb, scratch, explore, and be herself - without the shooing and scolding.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h4> <span style="color: #f6b26b;"><strong>Cats Natural Behavior Why You Should Have One:</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #f6b26b;"> </span><br><br></strong> </h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Scratching</strong>– A cat <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/your-cat-s-scratching-nature" title="scratching nature">naturally likes to scratch</a>. Most people think that when a cat scratches it is trying to sharpen or trim its claws. What it is actually doing is shedding its claws. When a cat scratches your furniture or a scratching post, it leaves the outer layer of the claw behind which encourages new growth. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Romping and climbing</strong>– Your cat’s natural instinct is to jump, climb, hide, and chase. To survive in the wild cats need to hunt and kill prey. This natural behavior still dominates how your pet cat acts indoors. <br><br></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Napping</strong>– cats sleep up to sixteen hours a day. Therefore, they love a safe and warm place to sleep rather than a loud or stressful place.<br><br></p> </li> </ul> <p>Although indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats, in order to be healthy and happy an indoor cat requires a good amount of exercise and daily challenge. Cats love to scratch, jump, play hide and seek with pretend friends, and between playtimes take extended naps on high perches.</p> <p>If you are tired of your kitty-cat romping on and shredding your expensive furniture, then consider providing it with some cat furniture. </p> <p>Functional pieces of cat furniture will help entertain him on his own furniture and keep him off of yours. Because your cat has certain instinctual needs, if you do not meet these needs with the appropriate cat furniture, you can count on your cat scratching your sofa because he has nothing else. If you don’t furnish a nice, warm place for your cat to sleep, he will curl up in your comfy bed around your warm face. </p> <p>To meet your cat’s innate needs you are not required to furnish it with elaborate designer furniture pieces However, following are some items at pet shops or online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a> will make your life and your cat a little less and happy. </p> <h2> <strong><br> <span style="color: #cc0000;">It’s Importance and Health Benefits!</span></strong><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong> </strong></span> </h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://www.islandvetgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-laying-down.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Did you know that having the right cat beds around your home is probably the most important factor to consider when owning a cat? We all know that having a <a href="https://amzn.to/2KBUuDP" target="_blank" title="cat dog bed" rel="noopener noreferrer">comfortable bed</a> to sleep in each night is important for us humans. </p> <p>But did you know that it’s just as important for our feline family members to have a comfy bed too? Just like us, getting a good night sleep is vital for cats. Our feline friends tend to sleep much more than us too, which puts even more importance on having a comfortable bed which they feel safe and secure in, before purchasing a cats bed.</p> <p>Does your cat have their own special place to sleep? Some pet owners think that cat beds are an unnecessary luxury which has no importance at all. After all, the cat has more than enough pieces of furniture to sleep on, such as the sofa, bed or even the clean pile of washing. Many pet owners believe that providing anything in addition to this would be spoiling the cat. However, this actually couldn’t be further from the truth. Providing your pet with their own bed may be far more important than you realize. </p> <p>If you reside in a suburban area or in the countryside, then you probably allow your cat to go outside, in which case cat furniture is not a necessity. However, if you do not allow your cat to venture outside or you live in a city and your cat stays inside all the time, then you and your feline friend can both benefit from cat furniture.</p> <h4> <br><span style="color: #e69138;">Here are some reasons: </span> </h4> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Place Like Home</strong> </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left;">It’s no surprise that every cat likes to have a special place where they can escape to when they want some peace and quiet. Cat beds are a place your feline can fully relax knowing it is their own space. This makes them feel safe and protected. It also gives them a sense of ownership.</p> <img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/4_7fcefbf5-88c6-4bc6-80fc-b83007909946_large.jpg?v=1522903422" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br> <ul> <li><strong>Coziness</strong></li> </ul> <p>For a cat, curling up in its own warm, cosy bed is just as satisfying as when we sleep in our bed each night. Having the right bed for your cat can help ensure better weight distribution and support for their muscles and bones whilst sleeping. Comfort also ensures undisturbed sleep, which in turn results in a much happier cat.<br><br></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Warmth</strong> </li> </ul> <p>Providing your cat with at least one comfortable bed is essential, but we strongly suggest having at least 2-3 around the house. Each providing a slightly different sleeping environment. Bare in mind that cat beds perfect for the cooler, winter months may not be suitable for the warmer summer months. Consider lighter, more for the warmer months so your cat can sleep in comfort whilst keeping cool. Warm, fluffy snugs are better suited to the winter.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Health</strong> </li> </ul> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/6_34bcf602-cd2c-4c1b-b451-4443bbaab31e_large.jpg?v=1522903499" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br><br><br>Unfortunately, cats can be just as prone to joint problems, such as arthritis as dogs and us humans. Senior cats, in particular those over 10 years, often suffer with arthritis. Providing the correct bed for them to sleep in can help take the pressure off sore joints and ease pain.<strong> </strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Mobile Beds</strong> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/7_ea355928-a214-4082-a0f8-21dbec53fff0_large.jpg?v=1522903545" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br>Some cats can be a lot fussier than others when it comes to finding that perfect place to sleep. Most cats prefer to be slightly elevated so they can see everything that is going on around them from a safe distance. Cats rarely like being stuck on the floor in a corner, unlike dogs. <br><br>The advantage of using cat beds means you can move the bed around the home. If you do have a particularly fussy cat, with a little bit of perseverance and patience as well as a suitable bed, your cat will quickly find their new special place before too long. <br><br>If you are still wondering which beds would be best suited to your puss, take a look at our recommended online pet shop like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au">activefelinesolutions</a>.<br><br><br></p> <h2></h2> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><br><br>Choosing The Best </span></h2> <p> </p> <p>Like many products today, there is also a wide selection of different pieces of cat furniture. Your choice will depend on the kind of cat you own and the amount of space available in your house. Understand that it’s not necessary to provide a giant cat tree; a small tree will do just as well. <br><br></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cat scratching post</strong>: </li> </ul> <p>If you can only afford one piece of cat furniture, a scratching post is the most important for the well being of your cat. A scratching post keeps a cat’s nails healthy while promoting great exercise.</p> <p>It encourages your cat to stretch and exercise its arm, leg, and back muscles that help it to run and jump. In addition, a post decreases stress while allowing your cat to mark its territory. Of course, the design as well as material and size determine the price, but do not compromise when it comes to size. The pole needs to be long enough and the base wide enough to accommodate your cat’s body weight. </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cat perch</strong>: </li> </ul> <p>Because cats love to climb up high, purchasing a cat perch that allows your cat to climb to the highest part in the room provides your cat needed stimulation. Perching high above its surroundings also gives a cat security knowing what lies around it. However, acquiring a separate perch is not necessary if you buy a cat tree.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cat tree</strong>:<strong> </strong> </li> </ul> <p>Most cat trees satisfy multiple needs. They have elevated perches, usually feature a scratching pole, and some include a cat condo where your cat can hide and also sleep. Some trees also include hanging toys.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cat bed</strong>:</li> </ul> <p>If you decide to provide a cat bed, you will need to keep it clean and free of bugs like mites, fleas and ticks. <br> <br>There are so many styles of cat beds available, that trying to pick the best one can make your head swim. Price is all over the map, too. Size, materials, quality and maker all influence the price, as will where you buy it.</p> <p> Sometimes, a cheap cat bed can be just as comfortable as a higher-priced one, though beds with special features like luxurious fabric and cat-safe heaters will obviously cost more. Ideally, you should shop for cat beds in person rather than online, so you can see and feel the fabric and check for quality, construction and safety issues. </p> <p>The quality of your cat furniture is actually more important than the size. Not realizing the purpose of cat furniture, many cat owners buy furniture for their cats to merely sleep or lounge around on. Since your cat will repeatedly scratch and climb on whatever kind of furniture you get, quality – not looks or size is what you are after.</p>
