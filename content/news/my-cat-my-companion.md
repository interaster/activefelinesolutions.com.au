<p>I love animals since I was a little kid. Unlike humans, animals give you unconditional love. They don’t dump you or leave you in the dirt. I love all animals, but for cats, they really strum my heartstrings.</p> <p>But one question remains, do cats make better pets than dogs? probably, it depends on who you are asking. Everyone has their opinion on that. But for me, I will always go with cats, for of course, practical reason and I have a soft spot in my heart for these cute feline companions.</p> <p>It's no secret that cats videos, photos and memes are all over the internet (trust me, try searching it on Google, you'll get tons of hilarious and adorable results), but they dominate the real world too. Survey shows that the number of pet cats compared to pet dogs in the US is actually higher. This means that people who own cats own several of these adorable pets (just ask your nearest cat lady), while dog owners usually keep the number of their pets pretty low, sometimes owning just one or a couple of them. Cat people tends to easily adopt new cats on their household, even if they already own a dozen of them, which can be done with minimal disruption. While one or two dogs can make a happy pet family, five or more doggies can be an absolute pain in the butt.<br><br><br></p> <h4> <strong>Getting One For Me</strong> </h4> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-1.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;" width="277" height="172">Is this your first time to own a cat? Or planning to adopt one? Here are the reasons why you should get one for yourself: <br><br><strong>1. Independent pets</strong>: Dogs are basically like kids, but furry. Even when you leave them alone to go to work, you need to make sure that they can get out to go to the toilet at some point during the day. This means you either need to go home on your lunch break, leave bang on the dot at 5pm, or pay for doggy daycare.</p> <p>Cats can be left by themselves for a while. You can take a short vacation and leave them at home. All they need is enough food and water to make it through. They don’t get separation anxiety and turn your house upside-down like dogs do. That'll leave you at peace while away from your precious feline companion.</p> <p>They also can take care of themselves. They really only need you to feed them and clean out their <span style="color: #000000;">litter box</span>, and give them some affection when they need it. Dogs are a lot of work to take care of. On top of feeding them, you need to walk them and give them endless amounts of attention. It's just too much (for a cat person like me)</p> <strong>2. Low cost</strong>, <strong>Low maintenance</strong>: Most cat owners will say that during its lifetime, you will send less money on owning a cat than a dog. While sometimes buying a fancy cat breed can be expensive, adoption fees for cats and kittens tend to be lower than those for dogs.<br> <ol start="2"></ol> <p>Have a full-time job? Cats are perfectly content to lounge and wait for you to come home. (After all, they're probably sleeping for most of the time.) Many dogs need a mid-afternoon walk from a professional dog walker, or regular socialization at doggie daycare, And lastly, one of the biggest recurring expense is the cost of food. Large, active dogs need substantially more chow, so comparing the diet of a Rottweiler to a house cat isn't exactly fair. However, when comparing food for smaller dog breeds, cat food is often still the cheaper option.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-exercise" title="Cat Exercise">Exercise</a></strong>: Cats don’t need to be taken on walks, or let outside. Mostly what they need is to eat, sleep, and hang out. Most people don’t have time to be taking their pets on walks regularly. Roaming around your entire house is enough exercise for them, or the "catch the moving shiny red dot" with a laser pointer to get a kitty-cardio workout and gives both you and your cat lots of fun.</p> <p style="float: left;"><br><strong><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-2.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;" width="407" height="271">4. Friendly</strong>: Majority of domestic cat breeds are good with kids, and let kids carry them around. Only very few cats don't do well with kids, but you never have to worry about the kids getting injured or killed by a cat like you do with dogs. That goes with your visitors or anyone new in your house too.</p> <p><strong>5. They keep quiet, most of the time</strong>: Cats are pretty quiet compared to dogs. Do you ever get annoyed when a dog’s barking wakes the whole house in the middle of the night or when the mailman pass by your property? You don’t have this problem with cats. Cats that are vocal never meow very loud enough to cause a scene, and when you have visitors they go off and hide and not jumping and barking all over them.</p> <p><br><strong>6. They are the epitome of <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cats-proper-hygiene" title="cleanliness">cleanliness</a>:</strong> Cats are naturally equipped with the implements to groom themselves: a barbed tongue with which to lick, forepaws they moisten with saliva and use as a surrogate washcloth, and teeth to dig out tougher debris. For that reason, they very rarely need a <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/bathing-your-kitty" title="bathing your kitty">bath</a></strong>. They don’t smell bad either like dogs do. And after you pet a cat, you rarely have the urge to wash your hands compared to petting a dog.</p> <ol start="3"></ol> <p>Most cats love to be brushed or combed by their favorite humans. It must feel as relaxing as it feels to us to go to a spa for a shampoo and scalp massage, You can tell by the contented rumble of their purrs that they enjoy it. They also enjoy some self-grooming every time they bathe. This is how much they love it. Dogs don't do the same and don't like being groomed as much as cats. Grooming your dog, especially bigger dogs, can be a nightmare sometimes. You can also take a look at the article <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-care-and-grooming" title="cat grooming">Cat Care and Grooming</a> for some ideas.</p> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-3.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"></div> <strong>7. They can be inside their entire lives and doesn’t need a lot of space</strong>: Cats can stay inside their whole lives as long as they have the necessities, and never get dirty and bring fleas and ticks into your home. You don’t have to worry about your pet getting attacked by wild and feral animals when they live inside.<br> <ol start="7"></ol> <p>You don't need to own or rent a huge house or apartment to have a cat. Cats don't need large spaces to live well and happy whereas dogs need space to run and feel comfortable. If you give your cat a shoebox or a paper bag, he will be the happiest cat in the world. If you have a big dog, you better have a big house -- front yard and everything, for they need enough space for them to run around and do their doggy work-out. If you have a cat you can be happy anywhere.</p> <p>This indoor-only lifestyle makes them a great option for families with limited mobility, or time to dedicate to long walks with their pooch, and no matter how small your place is, as long as his human companion takes the time each day to play with him and cuddle with him, your cat won't get bored. After all, this is the reason you're thinking of getting a cat, isn't it?</p> <strong>8. They are natural hunters</strong>: Cats are miniature versions of their wild forebears, the lions, tigers, cheetahs and jaguars of the world. Since it's domestication a couple of thousands of years ago, domesticated cats learned how to depend on humans for food and shelter, but the essential tools for hunting and killing prey never changed that much. Any critter that flies or crawls that wander inside its territory doesn’t stand a chance against a cat.<br> <ol start="8"></ol> <p>Cats pretty much exterminate pests from your house and sometimes shares it with you. A gift offered by a cat, whether a mole, bird or unidentified critter part, is the highest tribute it can pay, proof of devotion to you. Yes, you'll be nauseated by this gift, but a simple " Oh, thank you, kitty, that's so sweet of you." can make a cat's day.</p> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-4.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"></div> <strong>9. They are sensitive to emotions</strong>: Cats can sense your emotions. They can feel when you are upset and they want to comfort you. Some cats even know when someone is about to die. They are very emotional animals that love to be held <br>and cuddled with.<br> <ol start="9"></ol> <p>Contrary to popular belief, cats are super lovable and adore humans. A recent study found that cats actually prefer human interaction to food, which is a pretty big deal and crushes all the miserable stereotypes about them being cold.</p> <strong>10. Smart enough to use the bathroom, if trained well</strong>: Yeah, litter boxes can be a disaster at some point, especially if your kitty makes a shoddy work of the litter box after they make a deposit, but they are much easier to deal with than poop scattered all over the house. Cats can even be taught to be potty trained on a real toilet. isn't that awesome?<br><br> <ol start="10"></ol> <h4><strong>Care: Safe and Sound</strong></h4> <p>Now that you have read this and thought "Awesome! I should <strong><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/why-cats" title="get a cat">get myself a cat!</a>"</strong>, there are few things you need to take note before getting one so that your new feline companion will live a happy and healthy life under your care:</p> <p>1. Cats are indeed independent by nature, but they're not able to take care of themselves entirely. As I have said earlier, There are quite a few things you need to keep in mind when owning one.</p> <ol></ol> <p>Before you adopt, make sure that you choose the best feline companion for your kind of lifestyle. How busy you are and the amount of time you spend at home will be the basis on what kind of cat you should get -- very busy people may find it difficult to find the time for a cat that needs a lot of grooming and attention, especially the highly intelligent and active cats (Abyssinian, Cornish Rex, Ragdoll, Sphynx). But, there are cats that are ideal for the working lifestyle (Maine Coon, British Shorthair, Russian Blue). You need to do your own research for this.</p> <p>2. What if your circumstances change after the adoption? Or if you work long hours and still want a friendly face to greet you at the door every time you go home? Adopting a buddy (preferably another cat) for the cat to play with can be an excellent solution.</p> <p>3. Do you have any allergies? If you do suffer from severe allergic reactions, consider testing yourself for feline allergies before bringing a cat home (that goes as well to other people who are currently living with you). A safe bet is to choose a cat that is hypoallergenic. Consult your vet, books, or animal shelter employees for suggestions.</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-5.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;">4. Before you bring your cat home, take it to the vet for a checkup and immunizations. Also, schedule it in to be neutered as soon as age permits. It helps prevent uterine infections and breast tumors, which are malignant or cancerous in about 50 percent of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Spaying your pet before her first heat offers the best protection from these diseases. Neutering your male feline companion prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems.</p> <p>5. Get a good litter box and quality litter or try looking for a <a href="https://amzn.to/2KAR5W1" target="_blank" title="Cat Litter Box" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"3 in 1 Self Sifting Tray Cat Litter Box Simple Stylish Antimicrobial Pet Cat Toilet Training Tray"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'>3 in 1 Self Sifting Tray Cat Litter Box Simple Stylish Antimicrobial Pet Cat Toilet Training Tray</span></a>. Covered boxes can allow you and your cat more privacy, and clumping litter is easier to clean than cat poop all over the house. Regularly change the Litter and always keep the box clean or your house will smell terrible.

Cat waste is one of the worst smelling substances known to man and pine-based litters and wonderful environment-killing chemical-soaked litters are a couple of good odor-control options. Also, make sure you buy well-balanced, age-appropriate food for your cat.</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/my-cat-my-companion-6.jpg" style="float: left;"></a>6. Cats love to play. <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/cat-toys" title="cat toy">Toy</a> mice, string, and even empty boxes make for great amusement. Playthings needn't be expensive (homemade ones will do), just make sure there's enough to keep your cat happy, active, and mentally occupied. And yes, you will need to have a scratching post like the <a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTuXP" target="_blank" title="Cat Scratching Post Tree Scratcher Pole Gym Sisal House Furniture Tall Grey 92cm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Scratching Post Tree Scratcher Pole Gym Sisal House Furniture Tall Grey 92cm</a> in Amazon (it's okay if it is homemade too) or we can choose different types of posts that are also available at <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a> to avoid your cat on clawing to your luxurious hand bag, your pricey sofa, or your newly furnished wall.</p> <p>7. Catnip, and those little freeze-dried chicken nuggets are excellent tools for cat bribery and training. (trust me, it works).</p> <p>8. Get pet insurance. It is not necessary, but it's better to have one than none at all,</p> <p>9. If it's a kitten you're bringing home, make sure you start a grooming routine early. Bathing, brushing, and trimming claws will be your regular routine to make sure that your kitten will grow up healthy.</p> <p>If you’re thinking about where to get a cat, I urge you to consider adopting one from a shelter. They need you. They really do! There are so many cats that are either strays or have been abandoned and they need homes. Be one of those people who can give these beautiful and adorable creatures a better life than they deserve.</p> <p>And there you have it. I know it's a handful, but these are just a few of the things you need to remember when you get yourself a new companion. There is nothing like the bond that you will have with your pet, especially with your new pet cat (I can attest to that). And one more thing: Cats live for an average of 20 years, so you and your furry feline friend will be together for a long time.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
