Cats love chasing things that move, but sometimes Mom and Dad just don’t have the energy to run around waving and dangling things. This situation calls for the next best thing: an electronic cat toy.

All while you relax with a glass of wine on the couch.<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/top-10-must-have-cat-toys-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">With wand toys, you can make the “prey” crawl, climb, or fly through the air, to your kitty’s delight—and the manipulator of the prey’s action (you) is far enough away so that the prey’s movements seem autonomous. In fact, since the toy bug, bird, or burrower is attached to a string and is usually light enough to be affected by air currents and tiny obstructions on the ground, there is a degree of randomness to its actions.<br><br>Although our cats are too smart to mistake a toy moth or mouse for the real thing, the life-like actions of the toy prey, which you indirectly control through the wand, stimulate their hunting instincts and inspire them to put on their thinking caps. Fake prey generates real play!<br><br>By the end of the day keep <a href="https://amzn.to/2nF7Gdr" target="_blank" title="Feather Teaser Toys, niceeshop(TM) Retractable Wand Rod with 7 Pcs Refills Feathers, Interactive Cat Wand Toys for Cat and Kitten " rel="noopener noreferrer">wand toys</a> hidden and inaccessible to your cat when not in use.
