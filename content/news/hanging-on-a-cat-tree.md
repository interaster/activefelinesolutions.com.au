<p> A <strong>cat tree</strong> (also referred to as a cat tree house, cat condo, kitty condo, cat stand, cat post or cat tower) is an artificial structure for a cat to play, exercise, relax and sleep. Cat trees vary in height and complexity, with most cats preferring features offering height over comfort, particularly if tall enough to allow a clear survey of their territory. While most cats seem to prefer tall cat trees, some prefer options which offer shelter or a secluded escape, which may be at any height of the structure.<br><br>Cat trees are meant to offer cats a sense of security, by creating interactive areas that are only used by them (not used by people, dogs, etc.). While cat trees can help to deter cats from <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/your-cat-s-scratching-nature" title="scratching nature">scratching on other furniture</a> which is not intended for scratching, and in many cases may even eliminate the problem, not every cat will react the same and cat owners have reported varied results in that regard.</p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;">Why Your Cat Needs a Cat Tree</span></h2> <p> </p> <h3></h3> <h3>Form of Natural Defense:</h3> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/what-is-environmental-enrichment-and-why-does-your-cat-need-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image004_573aa420-3833-4ebc-acd5-2e4ae07c2c82_large.jpg?v=1526264012" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>We live in a horizontal world but cats aren’t limited to the horizontal side of life. Cats make use of horizontal and vertical aspects of the environment. In fact, they rely on vertical areas for safety, comfort and certainly for fun. Providing your cat with vertical options in his territory isn’t just a luxury, it’s a crucial part of feline life. In a multicat home, vertical territory can make the difference between a happy household and a feline battleground. One of the easiest ways to increase vertical territory is with a cat tree. Learn more by visiting <a href="https://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/why-your-cat-needs-a-cat-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Tree</a>.<br><br>When you have more than one cat in your home, the addition of cat tree increases the chances of living in harmony because cats of higher status can claim the highest perch. If the relationship between a couple of cats in your home is very tense, the ability for the higher-ranking cat to move to the high perch on a tree can be enough to let the other cat know who is in charge here. The ability to claim vertical territory may reduce the number of physical confrontations and tense stand-offs.<br><br></p> <h3>Secured:</h3> <p> </p> <p>If there’s a timid cat living in your home, the addition of a cat tree can provide a safe place for him to stay out in the open while still feeling secure. On an elevated perch, the cat has a visual advantage because he can see more of his environment and as a result, he’ll have more visual warning time of any advancing opponent. The elevated location also provides security because the cat knows he won’t be ambushed from behind.<br><br></p> <h3>Territorial Advantage:</h3> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/how-cats-time-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image006_15ae3cb1-9195-43d2-b21c-4c435b754013_large.jpg?v=1526264049" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>A cat tree is a great way to increase vertical territory because it provides the opportunity for more than one cat to share a close space while maintaining any sort of pecking order. Cats who wouldn’t share close quarters on a windowsill or table, may be at ease enough to share a cat tree. The different levels of the perches allow cats to be close together but not right next to each other.<br><br>Initially, a cat tree may seem to be an extravagant purchase but a good quality one will last many, many years. Additionally, a cat tree can serve more than one function for your cat as well. In addition to being a great place to perch, the support posts can be used as <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/scratching-posts" title="scratching post">scratching posts</a>. Depending on your <strong>cat’s scratching preferences</strong>, you can order cat trees with bare wood, sisal covered, or even bark covered.<br><br></p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;">Best Selection:</span></h2> <p> </p> <p>When shopping for a cat tree, or other products you may also visit some online stores like <span style="color: #ff9900;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all" style="color: #ff9900;">activefelinesolutions</a></span>. If you have a large cat, don’t choose a tree with small, flat perches. The cat has to feel comfortable on the perch and not be worried about a leg hanging over the side. Choose a tree with perches that are an appropriate size for your cat.<strong> Large cats need large perches.</strong> As for the type of perches to look for, Our recommendation is “U” shaped ones because they allow the cat to feel the perch against his back. Cats like to back up against things when resting because it helps them feel more secure and lest vulnerable to a rear ambush. <br><br>Cat trees (See: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Tree Scratcher PARALA 203 cm - GREY\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MTVgsw" target="_blank" title="cat tree" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Tree Scratcher PARALA 203 cm - GREY-amazon</a>) </span> are easy to find at your local pet product store or online store like <span style="color: #ff9900;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all" style="color: #ff9900;">activefelinesolutions</a></span>. Prices vary, depending upon whether you want a basic tree or an elaborate one. What <strong>matters most</strong> to your cat though will be the <strong>sturdiness, height and comfort</strong> of the tree. Wobbly trees will not get used by the cat and will be a huge waste of money. The <strong>taller the tree</strong>, the <strong>wider the base should be</strong>. When shopping, be certain the tree can withstand your cat leaping from the ground to one of the high perches without so much as a tiny wobble.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Cat Tree Location:<strong> <br></strong> </h3> <p> </p> <p>Once you’ve purchased the ideal cat tree, give careful consideration to where it should be placed. Typically, a great option is to put the tree by a window so your cat can watch the outdoor activity. If you don’t like the look of the cat tree and plan to place it in some unused bedroom or in the basement, then it’ll just end up gathering dust.<br><br>The tree needs to be located in a spot that your cat will find appealing.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image009_42e8e52f-6ddf-4409-a40f-dc4001dab684_large.jpg?v=1526264103" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Another benefit of a cat tree is it can be refuge for a cat who shares his home with children or dogs. If you teach your children that when kitty is on his tree it means he wants to be left alone, it will go a long way in the trust-building process. If your cat shares his home with a dog, train the pup that the cat tree is a dog-free zone.

There are many other things you can add as well. <a href="https://amzn.to/2KBUio5" target="_blank" title="cat bed" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beds</a> placed in elevated locations are a great way for cats to have cozy hideaways for naps. Window perches provide easy, inexpensive ways for cats to enjoy bird watching.

This option is great for small environments where there isn’t room for a cat tree. You can purchase cat shelves and walkways or make your own. If you do construct a walkway be sure and put a non-slip material on the surface. Also, in a multi-cat home, set up a stairway in more than one location so one cat can’t trap another cat on a shelf.<br><br>Vertical territory can even be as simple as constructing a homemade cat tree with sturdy cardboard boxes. Cut out holes on the boxes, stack them up and secure them with strong tape. Your cat will have a custom-made cat tree that certainly won’t break the budget.<br><br>Look around your environment and evaluate whether you’ve truly supplied adequate vertical territory for your cat. With just a little tweaking you can double and triple the size of your cat’s territory and create a more comfortable, secure and fun home.<br><br></p> <h2><span style="color: #990000;">Love Of Heights</span></h2> <p> </p> <p>Cats' playful, watchful, and sometimes private nature guarantees they'll seek posts and perches to survey their surroundings. It ensures they'll select hidden hideouts to nap within and coarse surfaces to scratch upon. It also explains the occasional breaking into hunting mode – when any moving object becomes prey.<br><br>The particular perch, prey, scratcher, or cubby your cat chooses is up to you. Appropriate environmental outlets encourage normal, healthy cat behavior while reducing the stress (and resulting inappropriate behavior) of sharing their environment with humans and other pets. A cat tree can help satisfy many basic feline needs in a single, space-saving unit.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Following Are Some Reason Why Cat Love Heights:</h3> <p> </p> <h3>Establishes Hierarchy:</h3> <p>Just like the courageous kitty on the cop car, cats prefer to be at the top of the social ladder – literally. Especially if you have multiple cats, you may notice that your kitty seeks high places in order to establish his role in the household. Like humans, cats seek ways to display their position in the pecking order, and height is one of the primary ways to achieve this.</p> <p> </p> <h3>It Gives Them Personal Space: </h3> <p>Unlike dogs, cats relish in quality alone time. To avoid disturbance, they seek refuge on top of refrigerators, book cases, and anywhere else that’s accessible. It’s not uncommon for mother cats to seek high places to temporarily escape her kittens during weaning time.</p> <p> </p> <h3>It Keeps Them Entertained: </h3> <p>Indoor cats can get bored quickly if they’re not provided with enough physical and mental stimulation. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ea9999;">Shelves</span> and cat trees provide felines with an outlet for play, allowing them to jump, climb, and see things from a new perspective. For more products you may also visit online stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/all">activefelinesolutions</a>.</p> <p> </p> <h3>It Keeps Them Warm and Safe:</h3> <p>It’s no secret that cats enjoy cozying up, and seeking high places to sleep is an easy way for them to accomplish this. Cats know instinctively that heat rises and tend to gravitate toward that warmth, especially during the winter months.</p> <p> </p> <h3>It’s instinctual:</h3> <p>Descendants of wild cats who hid in trees for survival, domestic kitties are hard-wired to climb high. Cats seek safety in high places that are out of reach of children and other household animals, and enjoy the ability to observe potential threats from safe ground.</p> <ul></ul> <h2> <br> <span style="color: #990000;">Importance Of A Cat Tree At Home</span> </h2> <p>Cat trees or cat climbers have a very important role to play in a cats life. They encourage many major functions, which are invaluable to a cats well-being. The climbing poles double up as scratching posts, allowing the cat not only to take care of their claws and exercise the surrounding muscles, but also to leave their scent on which for a cat is very important. <br><br>The climbing enables a cat to get exercise and is the closest thing to climbing a tree (a natural everyday action for an outdoor cat) and enables the cat to feel secure in a high place away from people or dogs, looking down on its territory.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image013_e6a330fa-3db3-4ecb-98cf-5bf49c11d57a_large.jpg?v=1526264178" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Cat trees encourage many major functions which are invaluable to a cat’s well-being – the climbing poles double up as scratching posts, allowing the cat not only to <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/healthy-benefits-of-scratching-to-cats" title="scratching benefits">take care of their claws</a> and <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-exercise" title="cat exercise">exercise</a> the surrounding muscles, but also to leave their scent on; the climbing enables a cat to get exercise and is the closest thing to climbing a real tree (a natural everyday action for an outdoor cat).
