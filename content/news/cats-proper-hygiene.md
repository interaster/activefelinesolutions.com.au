So their coat becomes smelly and gets very dirty and matted. <br><br>If you have a <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/taking-care-of-elderly-cats" title="senior cat care">senior cat</a> in this kind of situation, she certainly needs you to groom and bathe her frequently to keep her clean and healthy.</p> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <p><span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>When your cat is smelling. </strong></span>Some cats smell weird after coming into contact with something stinky or rolling in something, being skunked or recovering from an illness. If you notice that your cat has a strange odor or smells foul, it is definitely time to give her a bath. </p> <ul></ul> <p><span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>When your cat is dirty. </strong></span>Because of their curiosity, it is quite a frequent occasion that cats find themselves in situations that make their fur unusually dirty, especially if they go out.</p> <p><span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>If your cat has visible dirt on her fur. </strong></span>Regardless of what it is (like dust, fine sugar, makeup powder or any other thing), and it is beyond her grooming means, then bathing your cat is an absolutely good idea.</p> <ul></ul> <p><strong><span style="color: #e69138;">When your cat has something sticky on her fur. </span></strong>It is a common fact that cats like to rub themselves against every available object resulting in a sticky substance on their beautiful coat or paws.</p> <ul></ul> <p><strong><span style="color: #e69138;">When something gets stuck on your cat’s fur. </span></strong>And your cat is unable to clean it by herself, it is time for you to give her a bath.

If this kind of product gets into their coat, they should not clean it by themselves.</p> <p>Since it is dangerous for your cat to clean a potential poisonous product off of herself and you do not want her to become sick, you have to remove it yourself by giving her a bath.</p> <p> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #990000;"> Kind Of Health Issues To Bath A Cat </span></strong></h2> <p>There are different health issues that will hinder your cat from <u>g</u>roomin<u>g</u> herself properly. Therefore, it is essential to give your cat a bath every now and then.</p> <p> </p> <h5 style="float: left;"><span style="color: #e69138;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image011_4a97dd49-ebe9-4bfd-85f2-2b218ede24e4_large.png?v=1526008245" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></span></h5> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">When your cat grooms less or not at all</span></h5> <br>There are cats that groom less than they should, and there are the other ones that stop cleaning themselves altogether.<br><br>These cats’ fur become matted if there is no proper <u>g</u>roomin<u>g</u> care.<br><br>If your cat loses interest in <u>g</u>roomin<u>g</u> herself and doesn’t take care of her coat as she used to, you have no other option but bathing her regularly. <p><br>It is also wise to visit the veterinarian and ask for his guidance as this behavior could be a sign of some other health problem.</p> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;"></span></h5> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">When your cat is overweight</span></h5> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image013_6a1d8ba9-7761-4d5f-babd-f25bf523f563_large.jpg?v=1526008521" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Obese cats may not be able to groom themselves sufficiently and fully as they can’t reach all the places on their body (especially their lower back and rear areas) that would require grooming.</p> <p>Due to their limited mobility, their coat often becomes matted if there is no proper assistance. Because of the same reason, they are also at a higher risk of urinary tract diseases and other serious health problems.</p> <p>If your cat is overweight, it is reasonable to bathe her regularly to avoid getting mats and dandruff, and ensure she stays clean and healthy.</p> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;"></span></h5> <h5> <span style="color: #e69138;">When your cat has diarrhea</span><strong><br></strong> </h5> <ul></ul> <p>Every once in a while, cats develop diarrhea even if there was no change in their diet. Usually, after diarrhea a lot of feces will be stuck on their fur that they might not be able to clean by themselves.</p> <p>The minute you find out that your cat has diarrhea, you will need to prepare her for a bath. It is also important to consult your veterinarian to investigate the reason of this health problem.</p> <p> </p> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">When your cat is sick </span></h5> <p>Sometimes a cat can become sick or paralyzed. Depending on the severity of the illness the cat will spend less time grooming herself or will stop doing it altogether.</p> <p>If your cat is in this troublesome situation and it is very difficult or painful for her to clean herself, give her a helping hand and bathe her gently.</p> <p> </p> <h5 style="float: right;"><span style="color: #e69138;"></span></h5> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">When your vet prescribes a bath</span></h5> In some cases, cats can develop such a medical condition (like allergic skin disease or bacterial infection) that the veterinarian will suggest to use a specific shampoo that will help with your cat’s certain issue.<br> <div style="text-align: left;"></div> If you find yourself in this situation, please follow your veterinarian’s advice strictly about the prescribed medicated bath and bathe your cat accordingly. <p> </p> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">When you have allergy</span></h5> <ul></ul> <p>Cats are not the only ones who can benefit from getting baths. There are owners who are allergic to their cat’s fur, saliva or dander. In this case bathing the cat is not an option but a strong recommendation.</p> <p>If you or one of your family members or friends are allergic, it is recommended to bathe the cat regularly to eliminate the unwanted fur, reduce the dander and wash away the allergens that are likely to cause the allergic reaction.</p> <p> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #990000;">How often should I give my cat a bath?</span></h2> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image017_large.jpg?v=1526009061" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">For cat lovers, cat’s skin and coat healthy is important to your cat’s overall well-being. But, since cats can become aggressive or irritated when you try to bathe them, it is easy to get in the habit of skipping it altogether.<br><br>However, getting your cat into a regular <u>g</u>roomin<u>g</u> routine can help ease the stress and tension for you both! Plus, if you start them at a very young age, they can almost enjoy getting a bath. <br><br>The good news is your cat takes care of a majority of their hair care needs by themselves with all that licking, but that doesn’t remove mats, eliminate dandruff or make them smell better.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <span style="color: #990000;">How often you need to bathe your cat depends on the following:</span><br><br> </h2> <h5>Indoor vs. outdoor environment:</h5> <p>Outdoor kitties will need a bath more frequently than their indoor counterpart.</p> <ul></ul> <h5>Coat length and type:</h5> <p>Longer coats will require more maintenance than short coat cats.</p> <h5>Self-grooming behavior:</h5> <p>Cats that cannot or do not groom themselves efficiently need regular baths to keep their coat from becoming greasy or sticky.</p> <ul></ul> <p>Also, overweight cats have difficulty reaching all areas of the body, so they will need bathed more regularly – the back side of these kitties often become matted and the skin can become itchy, flaky or even infected</p> <h5>Activity level:</h5> <ul></ul> <p>Cats that are highly active will require more frequent bathing</p> <h5>Health issues:</h5> <p>Issues like skin irritation, tick or flea infestation and loose stool can require more attention.</p> <ul></ul> <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <br><span style="color: #990000;">Things You Should <strong>NOT</strong> <strong>Do</strong> During Bath Time</span><strong><br><br></strong> </h2> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2516/6600/files/image019_large.jpg?v=1526009122" style="float: none; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"></h3> <h3></h3> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">Do not let your cat know that he is about to be bathed</span></h5> <p>You must sneak up on the cat, kidnap him, and smuggle him into the bathroom where you will lock the doors, barricade him in, and then turn on the water.</p> If there are any cats to be bathed after this one, make sure you turn music on very loudly to drown out the screaming that is sure to be coming from not only your cat, but most likely you as well. You wouldn’t want to tip off your next victims. I mean other cats.<br> <ul></ul> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">Do not fill the tub up with water</span></h5> <p>There are many, many reasons that I advise against this. Sure, it seems like a great idea soap him up, and then dunk him clean but I assure you it’s not.</p> <p>What will ensure will be a scene straight out of some Animal Planet alligator wrestling show where the two of you will both be fighting for your lives while you attempt, in vain, to keep his sharp teeth away from you.</p> <ul></ul> <h5> <span style="color: #e69138;">Do not take a shower with your cat</span><strong> </strong> </h5> Enclosing yourself in a confined place where your feline friend cannot escape might seem like a pleasant alternative to having to physically restrain your cat in the bathtub, but I assure you it’s not.<br> <ul></ul> <h5> <span style="color: #e69138;">Do not try cat baths without backup</span><strong> </strong> </h5> <p>Do not be fooled by the fact that when you add water your cat shrinks down to half his size. You are going to need an extra set of hands to actually wash your feline friend while you battle to keep your skin in its original form while holding him down. You may also need someone to tend to your wounds in case you suffer enormous blood loss..</p> <h5><span style="color: #e69138;">Do not try anything fancy when bathing cats</span></h5> <p>If you have any fabulous ideas like taping baby socks onto your tiny feline friend’s feet to avoid being scratched, or wearing snow pants, bird gloves, and possibly a face shield while bathing your cat, forget it.</p> <p> </p> <h3>In Short..</h3> <ul></ul> <p>No matter what the reasons are, there are still plenty of it and circumstances when cats do need our help in <u>g</u>roomin<u>g</u> and why cats do need baths. </p> <p>There are lots of things to learn about your cat to keep it fit, healthy and happy - To know more please visit <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/importance-of-cleanliness-in-cats" title="importance of cleanliness">Importance of Cleanliness in Cats</a>.</p> <p><strong><br><br></strong></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
