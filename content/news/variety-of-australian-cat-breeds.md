<p>Having cats around us make it already part of our everyday life, whether what kind of feline we choose. We treated them like one of our family member, we talk to them, love them, feed them and shelter them. Here in Australia, almost every household have cats in their home aside from dogs also. Everywhere we go, we can see a lot of our feline friends, but one kind of breed here in Australia dominates all of the other breeds.</p> <p>Describing them as threatening and wild predators, but how much do we really know them?</p> <h2> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Feral Cats</span></strong> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br>Feral cats are one of the major invasive species in Australia, threaten the survival of over 100 native species in Australia<u>.</u> They have caused the extinction of some ground-dwelling birds and small to medium-sized mammals.<br><br>They are a major cause of decline for many land-based endangered animals such as the Bilby, Bandicoot, Bettong and Numbat. <br><br>Many native animals are struggling to survive so reducing the number killed by this introduced predator will allow their populations to grow.</p> <h3>Their Soft Side</h3> <p>The word "<strong>feral</strong>" is used to define a <strong>cat that lives outdoors</strong> and it essentially does not belong to anyone.</p> <p>Feral cats are the result of a domestic cat being abandoned or lost and left to fend for itself. The offspring of the domestic (now considered feral) cat are usually never handled by people and become terrified.</p> <p>Many times, when approached by people, they will hiss out of fright. Given the chance, they will run away and hide.</p> <p>This is misunderstood as being vicious, but that is not true. Almost all feral cats that are trapped will cower to the back of the trap and shake from fright.</p> <p>Some even urinate due to uncontrolled fright. If the trap were to be opened they would not attack, but run away.Ten to fifteen percent of the cats trapped are tame, abandoned cats.</p> <p>Some are even declawed. Others are elderly, guilty of nothing more than having lived with one person all their life until that person passed and surviving family members decided to throw the animal out.</p> <h3>Their Present Situation</h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.petcarerx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/feral-cats-blog.jpg?fit=550%2C325&amp;ssl=1" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Feral cats are the same species as domestic cats, however they live and reproduce in the wild and survive by hunting or scavenging. They are found all over Australia in all habitats, including forests, woodlands, grasslands, wetlands and arid areas. The map illustrates the estimated abundance of feral cats across the country. <br><br> Feral cats can carry infectious diseases which can be transmitted to native animals, domestic livestock and humans.</p> <p>Feral cats are predominantly solitary and nocturnal, spending most of the day in the safety of a shelter such as a rabbit burrow, log or rock pile. They are carnivores, generally eating small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects depending on their availability.</p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #990000;">Popular Cat Breeds</span></h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>In terms of popularity of cats, aside from Feral cats in Australia, which dominates most of the country. Let’s take a look at these other breeds of felines that mostly Australian love to take home with them. To help make your search easier, here are some listing of the most popular cat breeds in Australia. </p> <p><br><br></p> <h2><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Bengal Cat</span> </strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The Bengal is a relatively new companion breed. It was created by crossing a domestic cat with a wild Asian Leopard Cat, with the goal being to transfer the wild cat’s exotic markings to a new, tame domestic breed. Today’s Bengals are long, sleek and muscular cats of medium size. They come in a number of different coat colors and patterns.<br><br>All Bengals have spots, marbling and/or swirls, and many look remarkably like a tiny wild leopard. Bengal kittens are usually born with a fairly coarse, camouflage-patterned coat, which gradually changes to the adult color and characteristics. It can take up to one year for the mature leopard pattern to develop. It is preferred that Bengals have large spots arranged randomly in a horizontal flow, eventually developing into beautiful, peacock-like rosettes.</p> <h3>Health</h3> <p>The Bengal is a healthy, vigorous breed, with an average lifespan of about 15 or more years. There are no widely reported health concerns in this breed. The Bengal’s so recent wild ancestors crossed with completely unrelated domestic cats give it a particular health boost, called “<strong>hybrid vigor</strong>.”</p> <h3>Personality</h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">These beautiful, exotic and playful animals should have the disposition of a loving house cat, with the coloring and markings of a wild leopard. A sound temperament, without overt aggression, is essential in the domestic Bengal breed, given the closeness of its truly wild ancestors.<br><br>Bengals are naturally inquisitive. They love to cuddle. Bengals are typically extremely affectionate and devoted to all members of their home. They can be wonderful pets, especially if children, other cats and dogs are already established in the household when the Bengal is introduced. The Bengal has a wide range of vocal sounds and frequently communicates through unusual but pleasing chirps, trills and cooing.</p> <h3>Behavioral Traits</h3> <p>The Bengal’s unusual range of vocalization is distinct among companion cats and is one of the remaining attributes of its wild Asian Leopard Cat ancestry. Because Bengals are genetically so close to a wild feline, this breed should be kept indoors and managed very conscientiously. Owners of Bengals need to ensure that their cats have a stimulating living environment and receive plenty of attention, to keep them from becoming bored and potentially destructive.<br><br></p> <br> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Persian Cat</strong></span></h2> <p>Persian cats never go out of style. These fluffy felines are the quintessential fancy cat. Their noses may be permanently turned up but don’t be discouraged – they are very affectionate and playful, not snobby at all!<strong><br></strong></p> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-6.jpg" style="float: right; display: block; margin: 10px auto;"></div> <br> <h3>Personality</h3> <p>Loud environments aren’t a Persian’s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day. With large, expressive eyes and a <a href="http://cattime.com/cat-vocalizations-pet-insurance-101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voice</a> that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Persians let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold. <br><br>This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture. When you are at work or are busy around the house, the Persian is content to adorn a chair, sofa or most likely in their <strong>cat bed</strong> like the one (<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"iPET Deluxe Couch Pet Bed Bolster Soft Dog Cat Sofa Cushion Fleece Medium\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2KBUio5" target="_blank" title="cat bed" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPET Deluxe Couch Pet Bed Bolster Soft Dog Cat Sofa Cushion Fleece Medium-Amazon</a>) or you can take a look </span>at online pet store like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a> until you are free to admire her and give her the attention she willingly receives but never demands.</p> <h3>Health</h3> <p>Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Although they are beautiful and sweet, Persians are prone to a number of potential health problems, most commonly related to their facial structure:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Breathing difficulty or noisy breathing caused by constricted nostrils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dental malocclusions, meaning the teeth don’t mesh well together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Excessive tearing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eye conditions such as cherry eye and entropion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heat sensitivity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Polycystic <a href="http://cattime.com/cats-and-kidney-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kidney disease</a>, for which a genetic test is available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Predisposition to <a href="http://cattime.com/cats-and-ringworm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ringworm</a>, a fungal infection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seborrhea oleosa, a skin condition that causes itchiness, redness and hair loss.</p> </li> </ul> <ul></ul> <h3>Behavioral Traits</h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Persians are creatures of habit. They thrive in a stable, secure living environment and not particularly fond of sudden changes. With gentle and consistent reassurance, they can adapt to boisterous households. Most Persians are meticulous self-groomers. However, they still need their owners’ help to maintain their glorious coats, which can be quite a challenge. All in all, the Persian is a remarkably decorative and glamorous breed, and they appear to be quite happy to serve in those roles. They are content to languish about their indoor environment on the softest place in the house or draped over their owners’ shoulders, only to rise for an occasional meal, game of fetch or trip to the cat box.

It is physically in the same class as the Korat and Oriental Shorthair -- long, slender, elegant. It is of a medium size, and muscular, but compared to a swimmer in the compactness of its musculature.<br><br>When it is in full motion and stretched out, one can see that it has a long, graceful neck, but the neck is hidden by thick fur and high set shoulder blades when the cat is sitting, making it look as though it has a short, thick neck.<br><br>The Russian Blue appears bigger than it actually is because of its double coat, which is the most eye-catching feature of this breed. Dense, silky, and plush, the hair stands out at a 45-degree angle, allowing you to literally trace patterns into it, where they will remain until you smooth your hand over them.</p> <h3>Personality</h3> This is a well-behaved cat that is easy to train. Or, rather, it easily trains its people. It enjoys a good game of fetch and will keep the game going longer than you may have time for, you can also provide some cat toys for him to play like the ones at <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a>. And you will make time because the Russian Blue is known for actually appearing hurt when it has been ignored. Elegant, and reserved, this cat is also very playful, and loves to chase after toys or sunbeams (see also: <a href="https://amzn.to/2MVLTsB" target="_blank" title="laser toy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asien Pet Laser Pointer Cat Catch the LED Light Interactive Exercise Toy-Amazon</a>)<br> <p>The Russian Blue can spend hours amusing itself and does not mind an awful lot if it is left at home alone for the day, but it will be very happy to see you when you do arrive. This cat makes for an excellent companion, constantly following its owners about, and generally preferring one human above all others in the family.</p> <p>It should be added that the Russian Blue gets along with most everyone, including children. Their love of human company extends to impishly clowning to help calm a crying baby, and showing sympathy when their people get the blues by patting the face of the person.</p> <h3>Health</h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-care-and-grooming" title="cat care and grooming"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>There are no specific health problems related to the Russian Blue. It is a genetically sound breed, mainly due to it being a naturally occurring breed. <br><br>Brushing the coat is not essential, but is a nice addition to the weekly routine of <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/cat-care-and-grooming" title="cat care and grooming">other grooming</a>, such as brushing the teeth. This breed has a particular fondness for human company and will sit quite happily while being combed or brushed, since it is spending time with the one it cares for.<br><br>One important note to keep in mind with this breed is its love of food. It will eat beyond its need and ask for seconds, making it a sure candidate for weight related conditions if it is allowed to eat as much as it wants. The best prevention is measuring the food and giving it only at assigned times of the day, and making sure that everyone in the house knows that they cannot give the cat too many treats or scraps.</p> <h3>Behavioral Traits</h3> <p style="float: left;">The Russian Blue is a curious and tranquil animal. They are known for their friendliness and intelligence, and are somewhat reserved. <br><br>They have been known to play fetch, open doors, and are sensitive to human emotions. They enjoy playing with a variety of toys and develop loyal bonds to their loved ones and other family pets.<br><br>They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions. They are clean animals that are normally reserved around strangers, unless they are brought up in an active household. <br><br>Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks. Russian Blues can also be fierce hunters, often catching rodents, birds, rabbits, small mammals, or reptiles. </p> <p><strong><br><br></strong></p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Siamese Cat Breed</strong></span></h2> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-10.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Siamese, popular short-haired breed of domestic cat originally from Thailand, a country whose official name was Siam until 1939. The Siamese is a lithe long-bodied cat with slim legs and a long slim tail. <br><br>It has a long wedge-shaped head and blue eyes. Some Siamese have crossed eyes or kinked tails, but these features are discouraged by breeders of show animals.<br><br>The Siamese was first exported from Siam to the United States in 1878 and the United Kingdom in 1884. By 1902 the first cat fanciers club devoted to the Siamese cat had been established in the United Kingdom, and by 1906 the Cat Fanciers’ Association had officially recognized the breed.</p> <h3>Personality</h3> <p>This is an outgoing, social cat which relies heavily on human companionship. It is a born chatterbox, loving to communicate with those around it. However, this is not a cat to have if you're not home often, as it gets lonely and sad fairly easily. The Siamese cat needs to be handled carefully, but when it is shown love, patience and care, it makes an ideal <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/my-cat-my-companion" title="cat companion">companion.</a></p> <h3>Health</h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(cat)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Based on Swedish insurance data, which tracked cats only up to 12.5 years, Siamese and Siamese-derived breeds have a higher rate of mortality compared to other breeds. The median lifespan of the Siamese group was somewhere between 10 and 12.5 years. 68% lived to 10 years or more and 42% to 12.5 years or more. Siamese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(cat)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooter</a> holds the record as the world's oldest male cat, dying at the age of 30.</p> <p>The majority of deaths were caused by neoplasms, mainly mammary tumors. The Siamese also has a higher rate of morbidity. They are at higher risk of neoplastic and gastrointestinal problems but have a lower risk of feline lower urinary tract disease. Vet clinic data from England shows a higher median lifespan of 14.2 years.</p> <h3>Behavioral Traits</h3> <p>Siamese always have a lot to say, and they usually always have the last word. One of their most well-known characteristics is the legendary ability to vocalize. Siamese are the most extroverted and vocal of all domestic felines.</p> <p>They will hold conversations over almost anything, with food and human attention being at the top of the list. Their loud, long meows sometimes sound like a human baby’s cry. Intact female Siamese (and almost all Torties and Tortie Points are female) have a particularly renowned noisy call when they are interested in finding a breeding partner.</p> <p> </p> <h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><strong>Burmese Cat</strong></span></h2> <p>Burmese are compact but heavy, often described as bricks wrapped in silk. That doesn’t preclude them from being active and acrobatic.</p> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-12.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <br> <p>Their short, fine, silky coat comes in the original dark sable brown as well as dilute colors: champagne (light brown), blue and platinum (lilac).</p> <h3>Personality</h3> <p>Cuddly, confident and sociable - that's the Burmese! It's not just their glossy coat that has the wow factor, their personalities are just as impressive.</p> <p>If you're looking for an outgoing, lively cat who wants to be part of your family then the Burmese is for you</p> <h3>Health</h3> <p>Burmese are generally healthy, but there are some health conditions you should be aware of. Some Burmese may have cranial deformities, glaucoma or feline hyperaesthesia syndrome, which results in an increased sensitivity to touch or painful stimuli. They may also be prone to calcium oxylate stones in the urinary tract. </p> <h3>Behavioral Traits</h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/variety-of-australian-cat-breeds-13.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">These cats are known for having especially delightful personalities. They are described as being dog-like and sunny of temperament, because by nature they are friendly, kind, gentle and outgoing. Burmese also are usually quite playful, well into adulthood.</p> <p> </p> <p>Even within breeds, cat behavior, personality, and sometimes appearance will vary widely. Genetics and environment each play a role in an animal’s development, and one can never be certain how a particular cat will act and react to his humans or surroundings . In the end, your cat's preferences and attitude are as individual as you are.
