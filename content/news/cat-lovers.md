<p style="float: left;"><span>From aesthetically pleasing <a href="https://amzn.to/2KAR5W1" target="_blank" title="litter box" rel="noopener noreferrer">litter boxes</a> to posh kitty beds, the pet industry is starting to cater more and more to the design-loving cat person and their menagerie. If you've ever brought home a carpet-covered cat tree only to have your cat look at it in disdain, or witness your tabby scratching up your tired-looking furniture, you must know it's a sign. <br><br><br><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTuXP" target="_blank" title="Grey Sisal 92cm Scratching Post" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>As a discerning species, your cat naturally deserves the best—and, so does your home. One of the best things that you can invest for your cats are good, sturdy cat trees. When they come around, they will love those trees. <br><br>Looking for good quality trees, like the </span><a href="https://amzn.to/2MWTuXP" target="_blank" title="Grey Sisal 92cm Scratching Post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Scratching Post Tree Scratcher Pole Gym Sisal House Furniture Tall Grey 92cm</a> or <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cat Tree Scratcher JUMBO 180cm - BEIGE"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":8403841,"3":[null,0],"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"15":"Calibri, sans-serif","16":11,"26":400}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2MTiA9S" target="_blank" title="cat tree scratcher jumbo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Tree Scratcher JUMBO 180cm - BEIGE</a> in AMAZON, where you easily get one at </span><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/cat-tree/cat-tree">activefelinesolutions</a>. </p> <p><span> </span></p> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/collections/cat-tree" title="cat condo"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a><br><br>Having a cat tree or condo with leaves on it, or one that was designed to look like a real tree, was something a lot about considering with English ivy used for interior decor. Obviously, you wouldn’t dare have real ivy hanging around a cat tree. It’s toxic to cats and we all know how curious they can be about nibbling on house plants. <br><br>The fake stuff these days can be pretty darn convincing, however, so the fact that you would have to go fake never bothered us at all. And boy does a pop of green add some cheerfulness to a house. <br><br>Always assumed the only way you could end up with a pretty little fake plant covered cat condo was to DIY the fake plants on yourself. There are actually quite a few cat trees that come with leaves already. They come in a bunch of different shapes and sizes, and heck, there are even <a href="https://amzn.to/2vJJmv5" target="_blank" title="MagiDeal Cat Window Perch Window Hammocks Seat Safety Shelves " rel="noopener noreferrer">cat shelves</a> these days you can hang on a wall that will match nicely along with them.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <span style="color: #f6b26b;"><strong>Clean is Healthy</strong></span> </h2> <p>If you have issues with keeping a cat condo clean, say because your cat is anything like any other cats and leaps out of the litter box to his or her favourite spot and sits down without cleaning him or herself first – this might be your best option. Either way, it’s an excellent one to consider. It d<span>oesn’t stop you from considering buying a cat condo without leaves and adding some fake greenery of your own, but you may found a number of different cat trees that made you reconsider bothering – ones that don’t look cheesy at all. Anyhow, here’s what you can find in at online pet stores like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions</a>.</span> </p> <h4><span style="color: #ea9999;"><strong><br><span style="color: #e06666;">Glittery Litter</span></strong></span></h4> <p style="float: left;"><span><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">It can be more than a little difficult finding pet products cute enough to qualify as essentially decorative pieces for your home. Cat furniture is especially frustrating on this front – as most cat trees and litter boxes available are either incredibly boring or go so far as to end up in ugly-to-look-at territory and sometimes it may cause an unsatisfactory smell around your space. <br><br></span><span>It takes a lot more to prevent litter box smells than regular cleaning. </span>Of course<span> cleaning a litter box frequently is important, not just for keeping smells at bay, but to help your cat maintain top hygiene and health. That being said, if keeping a cat’s litter box clean was the only thing necessary to keep terrible smells away, hardly any cat owners would have issues with litter box smells, and this sadly doesn’t happen to be case. There is absolutely more to stinky litter boxes than mere cleanliness.</span> </p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you’ve got a little odour or an ungodly stench radiating from your cat’s litter box, know that your situation can be dramatically helped. There are plenty of things you can try out – so it’s easy to pick and choose which options suit you best (based on cost, ease, and what’s ideal for your cat’s well being, visiting pet stores or online like <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/">activefelinesolutions.com.au</a> may be a big help). <br><br>It may take a little trial and error at first, but once you’ve found your ideal system, a good combination of cat food + litter + litter box as we’ll get into, you’re set for life and those terrible litter smells won’t just be temporarily reduced, they’ll be forever kept at bay.</span> </p> <p><span>Hidden cat litter boxes were an option to be considered. The only issue: a lot of the boxes you may liked were hidden in furniture that’s a little on the big side, and </span>really<span><em> </em>don’t have that kind of space.</span></p> <p><span>What to chose to do instead was </span>grab the prettiest top-entry cat litter box<span> you could find.</span> </p> <p><span>In an opinion of a blogger and a cat lover, it’s been the perfect addition to a home, partly because it meant you could skip out on </span>litter mats<span>, which take up quite a bit of space, and partly because it aesthetically fits in perfectly with your furniture.</span></p> <p><span> </span></p> <h4><span style="color: #ea9999;"><span style="color: #e06666;"><strong>Our Beautiful Way of Understanding</strong></span> <br><br><br></span></h4> <p style="float: left;"><span><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-4.jpg" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"><br>According to study in early 2015, people were asked to share what they think about cats and cat owners. </span><span>They asked the survey participants about everything from stereotypes of cat owners to cat memes and videos. <br><br>Their responses showed that they could improve cats' lives by being proud of their loyalty to our feline friends. People learn about cats from friends, family and the Internet. <br><br></span><span>Respondents cited friends and family who own cats as their most common sources of information about cats (74%). People also said they got information about cats through past (66%) or current (54%) experience owning a cat. More than half of respondents said they got cat information from animal welfare organizations. We all know how popular cats are on the Internet — who haven't seen cat memes and videos shared online?</span> </p> <p><span>More than a third of respondents said they learned information about cats from Internet videos or social media. Furthermore, the survey showed that cat owners view and share more cat content than the broader population. More than half of cat owners said they talk about their cat or share cat videos.</span><span> </span></p> <p><span>As to Doug Dingus, a cat owner shared on Quora, cats appear to treat him more like a peer, unlike other animals. They are independent creatures who are there with us because they want to be. He finds that striking and very interesting. Bonding closely with a cat, he finds it a very special experience because it's genuine. Cats don't really have to bond all that closely with us, and they pick who they choose to bond with too. And he loves it when that happens because it's a lot like making a friend. Having this happen is simply not a given a cat.</span> </p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p><span>Cats present as little people to him. They lack spoken language, but they can be very complex creatures with more than casual thoughts about things and people and they regularly express this with robust body language and vocalizations and they are smart. As a species, they are generally smart, but the smarter cats really are something! </span> </p> <p>Another cat lover shared that his cat loves to scratch on the scratching post and it stays completely away from his furniture. The material should be very durable, that his cat's nails stay healthy, and it's tall enough for the cat to stretch on while they scratch, it's worth every cent.

They don't get why people have them, why many spend countless hours looking at hundreds upon hundreds of pictures of them – and the videos! Why so many viral videos of cats? Not only are these people not cat people – they don't even get cat people.</p> <p><span>She firmly believes that individuals like this likely just haven't had enough in-person exposure to cats in general, and haven't met the right cat in particular – for those who just don't get the cat love at all and simply want to understand what's possessed people with what seems to spread like an infectious disease, here are some reasons behind why people love cats.</span> </p> <p><span>As what John Amodeo, Ph.D., MFT also an author and a cat lover, expresses that these beautiful creatures have a rare quality that we humans would do well to cultivate: a large capacity to receive affection. When a lovely cat saunters our way, it's not easy to resist the impulse to stroke him or her, even when it's not so wise.</span> </p> <p><span>Elise Xavier – a blogger, shared her understanding with people and provided the reasons why cat lovers can't resist the beauty of our feline friends. </span></p> <h3> <span style="color: #f1c232;">Here are some of her reasons:</span> </h3> <ul> <li> <p>They are <strong>gorgeous</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Kittens are <strong>irresistible levels of cute</strong>. No human can resist that level of charm, even if they're not a fan of cats in general.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br><br></p> <ul> <li> <p>Pretty much every cat <strong>is quirky and odd</strong>. Cats quite frankly have such unique personalities from one another that we "cat people" find it hard not to treat them like tiny humans. </p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>When they're being antisocial and don't want your attention, it sort of just makes <strong>you crave their attention more</strong></p> . </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>And then when they do want your attention – for a <strong>cuddle</strong> or <strong>a belly rub</strong> or anything along those lines – it makes you extra happy because they chose to come to you on their own.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Scientific research actually shows that cats <strong>lower the risk of heart attacks</strong> in their owners. As Laura Moss put it, "A 10-year study at the University of Minnesota Stroke Center found that cat owners were 40 percent less likely to have heart attacks than non-cat owners." We don't know exactly why this is, it may be down to the fact that they purr, but either way, seems like there's some sort of biological reason why we love 'em.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Cats <strong>do</strong> really <strong>strange things</strong> out of the blue, like knock things off of tables because they just can't resist, trying to squeeze into cardboard boxes that should be pretty near too small for them to fit into, sitting in clothes and laundry piles we've yet to put away. These odd behaviors they seem to collectively exhibit are both hilarious and endearing to cat people. We-who-are-charmed by cats finds it quite easy to amuse ourselves watching cats doing these things for hours – doesn't matter if we're watching them through videos online or in the flesh.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li>People who obsess over cats – well our obsession is like an <strong>addiction with us</strong>. Cats to us are like chocolate to a chocoholic – a perfect way to get a quick and easy fix of happiness. Though luckily for us cat-o-holics, there's no downside of weight gain.</li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Many of the things people love about having dogs – the fact that they come to greet you at the door, that they desire your attention and love, that they are happy to have you around, and that they will go out of their way to seek out your cuddles and affection – are true of cats, too. You may think most cats just mind their own business the whole day and don't bother with humans, but those of us with cats know better – they're not as anti-social as their reputation suggests.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Those of us who house cats in our own home has the <strong>enormous benefit</strong> of rarely ever feeling truly alone. Even when they don't engage (as they obviously don't as much as dogs do), they're like a constant warm presence in your home that's comforting and not overwhelming or demanding.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Cats are really <strong>cathartic</strong> to talk to. Honestly, you may think cat people are crazy when they talk to their pets, but don't knock it 'til you try it.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Even when cats are being absurd levels of annoying (it happens, it really does), they are often so <strong>irritatingly cute</strong> while doing it that we forgive them in an instant.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>And of course, when cats misbehave and do things they know they shouldn't (again, it happens!), they've got that same <strong>irritatingly cute charm working</strong> in their favor that makes a cat person want to immediately forgive them. </p> </li> </ul> <p style="float: right;"> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Cats and other pets can feel like children who never grow up, which is nice if you like some of the many things involved in having a child: having someone who needs you, who wants your attention and affection, whose life is made better and happier by your existence and care. You may not care for these things, but there are many of us who love the feeling of being needed and appreciated. </p> </li> </ul> <p>You may also like to visit <a href="https://activefelinesolutions.com.au/blogs/news/how-cats-have-influenced-us" title="cat influence">How Cats Have Influenced Us</a>, to learn more of our feline friend.</p> <ul></ul> <ul></ul> <ul></ul> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/cat-lovers-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p><span> </span></p> <p><span> </span></p> <p><span> </span></p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
